	abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Considering the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in mitochondrial and cellular functions, we hypothesized that obesity and excess energy intake shift the balance of mitochondrial dynamics, further contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic deterioration in skeletal muscle. First, we revealed that excess palmitate (PA), but not hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, or elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha, induced mitochondrial fragmentation and increased mitochondrion-associated Drp1 and Fis1 in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells. This fragmentation was associated with increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, loss of ATP production, and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Drp1 attenuated PA-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial depolarization, and insulin resistance in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, we found smaller and shorter mitochondria and increased mitochondrial fission machinery in the skeletal muscle of mice with genetic obesity and those with diet-induced obesity. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission improved the muscle insulin signaling and systemic insulin sensitivity of obese mice. Our findings indicated that aberrant mitochondrial fission is causally associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Thus, disruption of mitochondrial dynamics may underlie the pathogenesis of muscle insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

The presence of this pathway would explain the reported low efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in S. cerevisiae, and may represent one of the postulated energy-dissipating mechanisms present in these yeasts. In this paper we demonstrate that ATP exerts its action in two steps: first, at low ATP/Pi ratios, it increases the respiratory-chain activity, probably by altering the kinetic properties of cytochrome c oxidase. Second, at higher ATP/Pi ratios, an increase in membrane permeability leads to a collapse in membrane potential. The ATP effect on cytochrome c oxidase corroborates a recent report showing that ATP interacts specifically with yeast cytochrome oxidase, stimulating its activity [Taanman and Capaldi (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18754-18761].},

	abstract = {Mitochondria contain their own genome, the integrity of which is required for normal cellular energy metabolism. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by normal mitochondrial respiration can damage cellular macromolecules, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and have been implicated in degenerative diseases, cancer, and aging. We developed strategies to elevate mitochondrial oxidative stress by exposure to antimycin and H2O2 or utilizing mutants lacking mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (sod2Δ). Experiments were conducted with strains compromised in mitochondrial base excision repair (ntg1Δ) and oxidative damage resistance (pif1Δ) in order to delineate the relationship between these pathways. We observed enhanced ROS production, resulting in a direct increase in oxidative mtDNA damage and mutagenesis. Repair-deficient mutants exposed to oxidative stress conditions exhibited profound genomic instability. Elimination of Ntg1p and Pif1p resulted in a synergistic corruption of respiratory competency upon exposure to antimycin and H2O2. Mitochondrial genomic integrity was substantially compromised in ntg1Δ pif1Δ sod2Δ strains, since these cells exhibit a total loss of mtDNA. A stable respiration-defective strain, possessing a normal complement of mtDNA damage resistance pathways, exhibited a complete loss of mtDNA upon exposure to antimycin and H2O2. This loss was preventable by Sod2p overexpression. These results provide direct evidence that oxidative mtDNA damage can be a major contributor to mitochondrial genomic instability and demonstrate cooperation of Ntg1p and Pif1p to resist the introduction of lesions into the mitochondrial genome.},

	abstract = {m-AAA proteases cleave OPA1 to ensure a balance of long and short OPA1 isoforms, whereas cleavage by OMA1 causes an accumulation of the short OPA1 variants. (See also companion paper from Head et al. in this issue.), Mitochondrial fusion depends on the dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatase OPA1, whose activity is controlled by proteolytic cleavage. Dysfunction of mitochondria induces OPA1 processing and results in mitochondrial fragmentation, allowing the selective removal of damaged mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrate that two classes of metallopeptidases regulate OPA1 cleavage in the mitochondrial inner membrane: isoenzymes of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent matrix AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities [m-AAA]) protease, variable assemblies of the conserved subunits paraplegin, AFG3L1 and -2, and the ATP-independent peptidase OMA1. Functionally redundant isoenzymes of the m-AAA protease ensure the balanced accumulation of long and short isoforms of OPA1 required for mitochondrial fusion. The loss of AFG3L2 in mouse tissues, down-regulation of AFG3L1 and -2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, or the expression of a dominant-negative AFG3L2 variant in human cells decreases the stability of long OPA1 isoforms and induces OPA1 processing by OMA1. Moreover, cleavage by OMA1 causes the accumulation of short OPA1 variants if mitochondrial DNA is depleted or mitochondrial activities are impaired. Our findings link distinct peptidases to constitutive and induced OPA1 processing and shed new light on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders associated with mutations in m-AAA protease subunits.},

	abstract = {Addition of benzoate to the medium reservoir of glucose-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 8066 growing at a dilution rate (D) of 0.10 h-1 resulted in a decrease in the biomass yield, and an increase in the specific oxygen uptake rate (qO2) from 2.5 to as high as 19.5 mmol g-1 h-1. Above a critical concentration, the presence of benzoate led to alcoholic fermentation and a reduction in qO2 to 13 mmol g-1 h-1. The stimulatory effect of benzoate on respiration was dependent on the dilution rate: at high dilution rates respiration was not enhanced by benzoate. Cells could only gradually adapt to growth in the presence of benzoate: a pulse of benzoate given directly to the culture resulted in wash-out. As the presence of benzoate in cultures growing at low dilution rates resulted in large changes in the catabolic glucose flux, it was of interest to study the effect of benzoate on the residual glucose concentration in the fermenter as well as on the level of some selected enzymes. At D = 0.10 h-1, the residual glucose concentration increased proportionally with increasing benzoate concentration. This suggests that modulation of the glucose flux mainly occurs via a change in the extracellular glucose concentration rather than by synthesis of an additional amount of carriers. Also various intracellular enzyme levels were not positively correlated with the rate of respiration. A notable exception was citrate synthase: its level increased with increasing respiration rate. Growth of S. cerevisiae in ethanol-limited cultures in the presence of benzoate also led to very high qO2 levels of 19-21 mmol g-1 h-1. During growth on glucose as well as on ethanol, the presence of benzoate coincided with an increase in the mitochondrial volume up to one quarter of the total cellular volume. Also with the Crabtree-negative yeasts Candida utilis, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Hansenula polymorpha, growth in the presence of benzoate resulted in an increase in qO2 and, at high concentrations of benzoate, in aerobic fermentation. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, the highest qO2 of these yeasts when growing at D = 0.10 h-1 in the presence of benzoate was equal to, or lower than the qO2 attainable at mu(max) without benzoate. Enzyme activities that were repressed by glucose in S. cerevisiae also declined in K. marxianus when the glucose flux was increased by the presence of benzoate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Using a novel screen, we isolated mutants in which mitochondria lose their normal structure, and instead form a large network of interconnected tubules. These mutants, which appear defective in mitochondrial division, all carried mutations in DNM1, a dynamin-related protein that localizes to mitochondria. We also isolated mutants containing numerous mitochondrial fragments. These mutants were defective in FZO1, a gene previously shown to be required for mitochondrial fusion. Surprisingly, we found that in dnm1 fzo1 double mutants, normal mitochondrial shape is restored. Induction of Dnm1p expression in dnm1 fzo1 cells caused rapid fragmentation of mitochondria. We propose that dnm1 mutants are defective in the mitochondrial division, an activity antagonistic to fusion. Our results thus suggest that mitochondrial shape is normally controlled by a balance between division and fusion which requires Dnm1p and Fzo1p, respectively.},

The ultrastructure of mitochondria varies considerably between tissues, organisms, and the physiological state of cells. Alterations and remodeling of inner membrane structures are evident in numerous human disorders and during apoptosis. The inner membrane is composed of two subcompartments, the cristae membrane and the inner boundary membrane. Recent advances in electron tomography led to the current view that these membrane domains are connected by rather small tubular structures, termed crista junctions. They have been proposed to regulate the dynamic distribution of proteins and lipids as well as of soluble metabolites between individual mitochondrial subcompartments. One example is the release of cytochrome c upon induction of apoptosis. However, only little is known on the molecular mechanisms mediating the formation and maintenance of cristae and crista junctions. Here we review the current knowledge of the factors that determine cristae morphology and how the latter is linked to mitochondrial function. Further, we formulate several theoretical models which could account for the de novo formation of cristae as well as their propagation from existing cristae.},

In theory, the ratio of [TMRE] in cytosol and mitochondrion allows ΔΨm to be calculated with the Nernst equation, but this has proven difficult in practice due to fluorescence quenching and binding of dye to mitochondrial membranes. We developed a new method to determine the amplitude of flickers in terms of millivolts of depolarization. TMRE fluorescence was monitored using high-speed, high-sensitivity three-dimensional imaging to track individual mitochondria in freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells. Resting mitochondrial fluorescence, an exponential function of resting ΔΨm, varied among mitochondria and was approximately normally distributed. Spontaneous changes in mitochondrial fluorescence, indicating depolarizations and repolarizations in ΔΨm, were observed. The depolarizations were reversible and did not result in permanent depolarization of the mitochondria. The magnitude of the flickers ranged from {\textless}10 mV to {\textgreater}100 mV with a mean of 17.6 ± 1.0 mV (n = 360) and a distribution skewed to smaller values. Nearly all mitochondria flickered, and they did so independently of one another, indicating that mitochondria function as independent units in the myocytes employed here.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that moves within infected cells and spreads directly between cells by harnessing the cell's dendritic actin machinery. This motility is dependent on expression of a single bacterial surface protein, ActA, a constitutively active Arp2,3 activator, and has been widely studied as a biochemical and biophysical model system for actin-based motility. Dendritic actin network dynamics are important for cell processes including eukaryotic cell motility, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. Here we experimentally altered the degree of ActA polarity on a population of bacteria and made use of an ActA-RFP fusion to determine the relationship between ActA distribution and speed of bacterial motion. We found a positive linear relationship for both ActA intensity and polarity with speed. We explored the underlying mechanisms of this dependence with two distinctly different quantitative models: a detailed agent-based model in which each actin filament and branched network is explicitly simulated, and a three-state continuum model that describes a simplified relationship between bacterial speed and barbed-end actin populations. In silico bacterial motility required a cooperative restraining mechanism to reconstitute our observed speed-polarity relationship, suggesting that kinetic friction between actin filaments and the bacterial surface, a restraining force previously neglected in motility models, is important in determining the effect of ActA polarity on bacterial motility. The continuum model was less restrictive, requiring only a filament number-dependent restraining mechanism to reproduce our experimental observations. However, seemingly rational assumptions in the continuum model, e.g. an average propulsive force per filament, were invalidated by further analysis with the agent-based model. We found that the average contribution to motility from side-interacting filaments was actually a function of the ActA distribution. This ActA-dependence would be difficult to intuit but emerges naturally from the nanoscale interactions in the agent-based representation., Cells tightly regulate the branched actin networks involved in motility, division, and other important cellular functions through localized activation of the Arp2,3 protein, which nucleates new actin filaments off the sides of existing ones. The pathogenic bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, expresses its own Arp2,3 activator, ActA, in a polarized fashion and can thus nucleate dynamic actin networks at its surface to generate forces to move through the cytoplasm. This bacterium has thus served as a simplified system for experimental and modeling studies of actin-based motility. We use this bacterial system to quantify the relationship between ActA polarity and bacterial speed of motion by experimentally manipulating this polarity and analyzing the resultant ActA distributions and bacterial trajectories. Like many cellular behaviors, L. monocytogenes motility emerges from a complex set of biochemical and force-based interactions. We therefore probe this polarity-speed relationship with a detailed agent-based simulation which encodes the predominant biochemical reactions and whose agents (actin filaments, ActA proteins, and the bacterium) exchange forces. We contrast conclusions from this agent-based model with those from a simpler mathematical model. From these studies we assert the importance of a heretofore neglected force in this system – friction between actin filaments and the bacterial surface.},

	abstract = {NDI1 is the unique gene encoding the internal mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of electrons from intramitochondrial NADH to ubiquinone. Surprisingly, NDI1 is not essential for respiratory growth. Here we demonstrate that this is due to in vivo activity of an ethanol-acetaldehyde redox shuttle, which transfers the redox equivalents from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Cytosolic NADH can be oxidized by the external NADH dehydrogenases. Deletion of ADH3, encoding mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase, did not affect respiratory growth in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures. Also, an ndi1Δ mutant was capable of respiratory growth under these conditions. However, when both ADH3 and NDI1 were deleted, metabolism became respirofermentative, indicating that the ethanol-acetaldehyde shuttle is essential for respiratory growth of the ndi1Δ mutant. In anaerobic batch cultures, the maximum specific growth rate of the adh3Δ mutant (0.22 h−1) was substantially reduced compared to that of the wild-type strain (0.33 h−1). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ethanol-acetaldehyde shuttle is also involved in maintenance of the mitochondrial redox balance under anaerobic conditions. Finally, it is shown that another mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase is active in the adh3Δ ndi1Δ mutant, contributing to residual redox-shuttle activity in this strain.},

The MITO-MAP provides a comprehensive view of mitochondrial function including insights into the activity of uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins and the functional connection between mitochondria and the ER. The MITO-MAP also reveals a large inner membrane–associated complex, which we term MitOS for mitochondrial organizing structure, comprised of Fcj1/Mitofilin, a conserved inner membrane protein, and five additional components. MitOS physically and functionally interacts with both outer and inner membrane components and localizes to extended structures that wrap around the inner membrane. We show that MitOS acts in concert with ATP synthase dimers to organize the inner membrane and promote normal mitochondrial morphology. We propose that MitOS acts as a conserved mitochondrial skeletal structure that differentiates regions of the inner membrane to establish the normal internal architecture of mitochondria.},

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose functional integrity requires a coordinated supply of proteins and phospholipids. Defined functions of specific phospholipids, like the mitochondrial signature lipid cardiolipin, are emerging in diverse processes, ranging from protein biogenesis and energy production to membrane fusion and apoptosis. The accumulation of phospholipids within mitochondria depends on interorganellar lipid transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria as well as intramitochondrial lipid trafficking. The discovery of proteins that regulate mitochondrial membrane lipid composition and of a multiprotein complex tethering ER to mitochondrial membranes has unveiled novel mechanisms of mitochondrial membrane biogenesis.},

Cristae, inner membrane invaginations that fold into the matrix space, are proposed to be the site of oxidative phosphorylation, reactions by which ATP synthase produces ATP. ATP synthase is also thought to have a role in crista morphogenesis. To date, the exploration of the processes regulating mitochondrial internal compartmentalization have been mostly limited to electron microscopy. Here, we describe ATP synthase localization in living yeast cells and show that it clusters as discrete inner membrane domains. These domains are dynamic within the mitochondrial network. They are impaired in mutants defective in crista morphology and partially overlap with the crista-associated MICOS–MINOS–MITOS complex. Finally, ATP synthase occupancy increases with the cellular demand for OXPHOS. Overall our data suggest that domains in which ATP synthases are clustered correspond to mitochondrial cristae. Being able to follow mitochondrial sub-compartments in living yeast cells opens new avenues to explore the mechanisms involved in inner membrane remodeling, an architectural feature crucial for mitochondrial activities.},

	abstract = {A method for the estimation of the yield on energy (Y ATP) and of the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, in vivo (P/O ratio) is described, which is based on the measurement of effective gas exchange values ( TeXQ\_\{O\_2 \} and TeXQ\_\{CO\_2 \} ) and of the yield coefficient Y of continuously growing populations of baker's yeast which vary in the degree of fermentation and respiration. For Y ATP a value of 12.0±0.5 TeX{\textbackslash}frac\{\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{mg dry weight formed\}\}\}\}\{\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{mMole ATP\}\}\}\} and for P/O ratio one of 1.1±0.05 TeX{\textbackslash}frac\{\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{mMole ATP\}\}\}\}\{\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{1/2 mMole O\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{2\}\} \}\} was found and seems to be independent of the type of glucose catabolism (under glucose limitation). The gas exchange of populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae synchronized at different growth rates was determined. The specific oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide formation rate, Q O 2, and Q CO 2, are shown to depend on the state of the cells in the budding cycle. Increase in gas metabolism and therefore increased energy generation coincides with the initiation of budding. The longer the generation time g the more expressed are these oscillations of energy formation over the budding cycle. The relationship between the course of energy generation and energy storage and the sequence of budding and single cell phase over the division cycle is discussed.},

	abstract = {DsRed is a recently cloned 28-kDa fluorescent protein responsible for the red coloration around the oral disk of a coral of the Discosoma genus. DsRed has attracted tremendous interest as a potential expression tracer and fusion partner that would be complementary to the homologous green fluorescent protein from Aequorea, but very little is known of the biochemistry of DsRed. We now show that DsRed has a much higher extinction coefficient and quantum yield than previously reported, plus excellent resistance to pH extremes and photobleaching. In addition, its 583-nm emission maximum can be further shifted to 602 nm by mutation of Lys-83 to Met. However, DsRed has major drawbacks, such as strong oligomerization and slow maturation. Analytical ultracentrifugation proves DsRed to be an obligate tetramer in vitro, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements and yeast two-hybrid assays verify oligomerization in live cells. Also, DsRed takes days to ripen fully from green to red in vitro or in vivo, and mutations such as Lys-83 to Arg prevent the color change. Many potential cell biological applications of DsRed will require suppression of the tetramerization and acceleration of the maturation.},

	abstract = {The degree to which diffusion contributes to positioning cellular structures is an open question. Here we investigate the question of whether diffusive motion of centrin granules would allow them to interact with the mother centriole. The role of centrin granules in centriole duplication remains unclear, but some proposed functions of these granules, for example in providing pre-assembled centriole subunits, or by acting as unstable “pre-centrioles” that need to be captured by the mother centriole (), require the centrin foci to reach the mother. To test whether diffusive motion could permit such interactions in the necessary time scale, we measured the motion of centrin-containing foci in living human U2OS cells. We found that these centrin foci display apparently diffusive undirected motion. Using the apparent diffusion constant obtained from these measurements, we calculated the time scale required for diffusion to capture by the mother centrioles and found that it would greatly exceed the time available in the cell cycle. We conclude that mechanisms invoking centrin foci capture by the mother, whether as a pre-centriole or as a source of components to support later assembly, would require a form of directed motility of centrin foci that has not yet been observed.},

	abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reproduces by asymmetric cell division, or budding. In each cell division, the daughter cell is usually smaller and younger than the mother cell, as defined by the number of divisions it can potentially complete before it dies. Although individual yeast cells have a limited life span, this age asymmetry between mother and daughter ensures that the yeast strain remains immortal. To understand the mechanisms underlying age asymmetry, we have isolated temperature-sensitive mutants that have limited growth capacity. One of these clonal-senescence mutants was in ATP2, the gene encoding the beta-subunit of mitochondrial F(1), F(0)-ATPase. A point mutation in this gene caused a valine-to-isoleucine substitution at the ninetieth amino acid of the mature polypeptide. This mutation did not affect the growth rate on a nonfermentable carbon source. Life-span determinations following temperature shift-down showed that the clonal-senescence phenotype results from a loss of age asymmetry at 36 degrees, such that daughters are born old. It was characterized by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential followed by the lack of proper segregation of active mitochondria to daughter cells. This was associated with a change in mitochondrial morphology and distribution in the mother cell and ultimately resulted in the generation of cells totally lacking mitochondria. The results indicate that segregation of active mitochondria to daughter cells is important for maintenance of age asymmetry and raise the possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a normal cause of aging. The finding that dysfunctional mitochondria accumulated in yeasts as they aged and the propensity for old mother cells to produce daughters depleted of active mitochondria lend support to this notion. We propose, more generally, that age asymmetry depends on partition of active and undamaged cellular components to the progeny and that this "filter" breaks down with age.},

	abstract = {Mitophagy is an autophagic process that degrades mitochondria by an intracellular engulfment that leads to their delivery into the lumen of the cell's hydrolytic compartment, such as the lysosome in animal cells or the vacuole in yeast. It is hypothesized that such processes serve a quality control function to prevent or slow the accumulation of malfunctioning mitochondria, which are thought in turn to underlie central aspects of the aging process in eukaryotic organisms. We recently identified a conserved mitochondrial protein phosphatase homolog, Aup1, which is required for efficient stationary phase mitophagy in yeast. In the present report, we demonstrate that the retrograde signaling pathway (RTG) is defective in aup1Δ mutants. In agreement with a role for Aup1 in the regulation of the RTG pathway, we find that deletion of RTG3, a transcription factor that mediates the RTG response, causes a defect in stationary phase mitophagy and that deletion of AUP1 leads to changes in Rtg3 phosphorylation patterns under these conditions. In addition, we find that mitophagic conditions lead to induction of RTG pathway target genes in an Aup1-dependent fashion. Thus, our results suggest that the function of Aup1 in mitophagy could be explained through its regulation of Rtg3-dependent transcription.},

Scarce is our understanding of the role of mitochondria and of their morphology during autophagy, a bulk degradation and recycling process of eukaryotic cells’ constituents. Here we show that mitochondrial morphology determines the cellular response to macroautophagy. When autophagy is triggered, mitochondria elongate in vitro and in vivo. Upon starvation cellular cAMP levels increase and protein kinase A (PKA) becomes activated. PKA in turn phosphorylates the pro-fission dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1) that is therefore retained in the cytoplasm, leading to unopposed mitochondrial fusion. Elongated mitochondria are spared from autophagic degradation, possess more cristae, increase dimerization and activity of ATP synthase, and maintain ATP production. When elongation is genetically or pharmacologically blocked, mitochondria conversely consume ATP, precipitating starvation-induced death. Thus, regulated changes in mitochondrial morphology determine the fate of the cell during autophagy.},

Here we demonstrate a mitochondrial reticulum providing a conductive pathway for energy distribution, in the form of the proton-motive force, throughout the mouse skeletal muscle cell. Within this reticulum, we find proteins associated with mitochondrial proton-motive force production preferentially in the cell periphery and proteins that use the proton-motive force for ATP production in the cell interior near contractile and transport ATPases. Furthermore, we show a rapid, coordinated depolarization of the membrane potential component of the proton-motive force throughout the cell in response to spatially controlled uncoupling of the cell interior. We propose that membrane potential conduction via the mitochondrial reticulum is the dominant pathway for skeletal muscle energy distribution.},

	abstract = {Yeasts are unicellular eukaryotes, and are used widely as a model system in basic and applied field of life science, medicine, and biotechnology. The ultrastructure of yeast cells was first studied in 1957 and the techniques used have advanced greatly in the 40 years since then; an overview of these methods is first presented in this review. The ultrastructure of budding and dimorphic yeast cells observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) after thin sectioning and freeze-etching are then described, followed by discussion of the regeneration of the cell wall ofCandida albicans protoplasts detected by cryosectioning.C. albicans protoplasts are regenerated to synthesize microfibrils on their surface. They are aggregated into thicker bundles which are intermeshed, forming a wide-meshed network of long fibrils. These microfibrillar structures are chains of β-1,3-glucan which are broken down after treatment with β-1,3-glucanase. Morphologically identical microfibrils are synthesizedin vitro by a cell-free system in which the active cell membrane fraction as a source of β-1,3-glucan synthetase and UDP glucose as the sole substrate are used. The diameter of an elemental fibril of β-glucan is estimated to be 2.8 nm from the pattern of autocorrelation of the image obtained by computer processing. In contrast, in the presence of aculeacin A the formation of normal fibrillar nets or bundles is significantly inhibited, resulting in the occurrence of short fibrils. These electron microscopic data suggest that aculeacin A inhibits not only the synthesis of β-1,3-glucan but the aggregation of microfibrils of this polysaccharide, allowing formation of the crystalline structure. On the basis of the cumulative data obtained from the electron microscopic studies, we are led to the assumption thatde novo synthesized β-glucan chains might initially form fine particles which are then transformed into thin fibrils with single to multiple strands which appear to be oriented parallel to each other so that they develop into fibrillar structures. This process of assembly of β-glucan molecules leads to the development of a fibrous network within the regeneratingCandida cell wall. Third, the mechanism of cell wall formation is shown by low-voltage (LV) SEM and TEM, using various techniques and computer graphics, of the regeneration system ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe protoplasts: after 10 min of regeneration, the protoplasts begin to grow fibrillar substances of a β-glucan nature, and a fibrillar network covers the surface of all protoplasts. The network is originally formed as fine particles on the protoplasts surface and these are subsequently lengthened to microfibrils 2 nm thick. The microfibrils twist around each other and develop into 8 nm thick fibrils forming flat bundles 16 nm thick. Interfibrillar spaces are gradually filled with amorphous particles of an α-galactomannan nature and, finally, the complete cell wall is formed after 12 h. Treatment of reverting protoplasts with RuO4 provided clear TEM images of glucan fibrils with high electron density. The relationship between cell wall regeneration and intracellular organelles was examined by using serial thin sections stained with PATAg and computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction. The secretory vesicles in a protoplast had increased markedly by 1.4, 3.4, and 5.8 times at 1.5, 3.0, and 5 h, respectively. Three-dimensional analysis indicates that Golgi apparatus are located close together in the nucleus of the protoplast and are dispersed into the cytoplasm during the progress of cell wall formation.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on spatial transforms, which can be combined with spectral transforms for certain applications such as image fusion and feature extraction for classification. Spatial transforms provide tools to extract or modify the spatial information in remote-sensing images. Some transforms such as convolution use only local image information, that is, within relatively small neighborhoods of a given pixel. Others, for example, the Fourier transform, use global spatial content. Between these two extremes, the increasingly important category of scale-space filters, including Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids and the wavelet transform provide data representations that allow access to spatial information over a wide range of scales, from local to global. The chapter concludes the following points: convolution and Fourier transform filtering are equivalent global processing techniques, except in the border region; a wide range of processing can be performed with small neighborhood windows, including noise removal and edge detection; scale-space filters allow access to image features according to their size, which is not possible with linear convolution or Fourier filters; and the resolution pyramid provides a unified description of scale-space filters, for example, Gaussian, Laplacian, and wavelet pyramids.},

        Mitochondria are “cellular power plants” that synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from degradation of nutrients, providing chemical energy for cellular activities. In addition, mitochondria are involved in a range of other cellular processes, such as signaling, cell differentiation, cell death, cell cycle and cell growth. Dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, and may play a role in the aging process. Previous studies on the correlation between mitochondrial morphological changes and pathological processes involve mostly manual or semi-automated classification and quantification of morphological features, which introduces biases and inconsistency, and are labor intensive. In this work we have developed an automated quantification system for mitochondrial morphology, which is able to extract and distinguish six representative morphological subtypes within cells. Using this system, we have analyzed 1422 cells and extracted more than 200 thousand individual mitochondrion, and calculated morphological statistics for each cell. From the numerical results we were able to derive new biological conclusions about mitochondrial morphological dynamics. With this new system, investigations of mitochondrial morphology can be scaled up and objectively quantified, allowing standardization of morphological distinctions and replicability between experiments. This system will facilitate future research on the relation between subcellular morphology and various physiological processes.},

	abstract = {The application of the conventional double-fixation method (glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide) to whole yeast cells is difficult because the thick cell wall of the yeast prevents the penetration of osmium tetroxide. However, this problem was solved by using the freeze-substitution fixation method. Therefore, it was possible to examine the intracellular structures of the yeast cells without digestion of the cell wall. In the present method, specimens for transmission electron microscopy and for scanning electron microscopy were prepared simultaneously. By scanning electron microscopic observation, three-dimensional information about internal structures was obtained. In the cytological analysis of the yeasts, intracellular structures were well preserved by using the freeze-substitution fixation method. On the outer leaflet of the nuclear envelope, many ribosomes were attached. The rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus were clearly seen in the yeast cytoplasm. The Golgi stack appeared to consist of smooth membranes, and small vesicles were present beside it. The details of other structures such as the nuclear division apparatus, actinlike filaments, and viruslike particles were also revealed. The present technique can be applied to most species of yeast cells. With this new information, the previous model of a yeast cell was modified.},

	abstract = {To gain insight into the process of mitochondrial transmission in yeast, we directly labeled mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and observed their fate after the fusion of two cells. To this end, mitochondrial proteins in haploid cells of opposite mating type were labeled with different fluorescent dyes and observed by fluorescence microscopy after mating of the cells. Parental mitochondrial protein markers rapidly redistributed and colocalized throughout zygotes, indicating that during mating, parental mitochondria fuse and their protein contents intermix, consistent with results previously obtained with a single parentally derived protein marker. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of mitochondria in living cells with wide-field fluorescence microscopy indicated that mitochondria form a single dynamic network, whose continuity is maintained by a balanced frequency of fission and fusion events. Thus, the complete mixing of mitochondrial proteins can be explained by the formation of one continuous mitochondrial compartment after mating. In marked contrast to the mixing of parental mitochondrial proteins after fusion, mtDNA (labeled with the thymidine analogue 5-bromodeoxyuridine) remained distinctly localized to one half of the zygotic cell. This observation provides a direct explanation for the genetically observed nonrandom patterns of mtDNA transmission. We propose that anchoring of mtDNA within the organelle is linked to an active segregation mechanism that ensures accurate inheritance of mtDNA along with the organelle.},

It has several splice variants and even a single variant is found as several processed forms, although their functional significance is unknown. In yeast, mitochondrial rhomboid protease regulates mitochondrial function and morphology through proteolytic cleavage of Mgm1, the yeast homolog of OPA1. We demonstrate that OPA1 variants are synthesized with a bipartite-type mitochondrial targeting sequence. During import, the matrix-targeting signal is removed and processed forms (L-isoforms) are anchored to the inner membrane in type I topology. L-isoforms undergo further processing in the matrix to produce S-isoforms. Knockdown of OPA1 induced mitochondrial fragmentation, whose network morphology was recovered by expression of L-isoform but not S-isoform, indicating that only L-isoform is fusion-competent. Dissipation of membrane potential, expression of m-AAA protease paraplegin, or induction of apoptosis stimulated this processing along with the mitochondrial fragmentation. Thus, mammalian mitochondrial function and morphology is regulated through processing of OPA1 in a -dependent manner.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic graphical models such as Markov random fields, Bayesian networks and decision networks (a.k.a. influence diagrams) provide powerful frameworks for representing and exploiting dependence structures in complex systems. However, making predictions or decisions using graphical models involve challenging computational problems of optimization and/or estimation in high dimensional spaces. These include combinatorial optimization tasks such as maximum a posteriori (MAP), which finds the most likely configuration, or marginalization tasks that calculate the normalization constants or marginal probabilities. Even more challenging tasks require a hybrid of both: marginal MAP tasks find the optimal MAP prediction while marginalizing over missing information or latent variables, while decision-making problems search for optimal policies over decisions in single- or multi-agent systems, in order to maximize expected utility in uncertain environments.
All these problems are generally NP-hard, creating a need for efficient approximations. The last two decades have witnessed significant progress on traditional optimization and marginalization problems, especially via the development of variational message passing algorithms. However, there has been less progress on the more challenging marginal MAP and decision-making problems.
This thesis presents a unified variational representation for all these problems. Based on our framework, we derive a class of efficient algorithms that combines the advantages of several existing algorithms, resulting in improved performance on traditional marginalization and optimization tasks. More importantly, our framework allows us to easily extend most or all existing variational algorithms to hybrid inference and decision-making tasks, and significantly improves our ability to solve these difficult problems. In particular, we propose a spectrum of efficient belief propagation style algorithms with "message passing" forms, which are simple, fast and amenable to parallel or distributed computation. We also propose a set of convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, which have the nice form of transforming the hybrid inference problem into a sequence of standard marginalization problems. We show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing approaches in terms of both empirical performance and theoretical properties.},

	abstract = {Beyond their fundamental role in energy metabolism, mitochondria perform a great variety of other important cellular functions. However, the interplay among these various roles of mitochondria is still poorly understood, and the underlying mechanisms can be related to system level properties. Importantly, mitochondria localized in different regions of a cell may display different morphology, dissimilar biochemical properties, or may differently interact with other intracellular structures. Recent advances in live imaging techniques have also revealed a functional heterogeneity of mitochondria with respect to mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, respiratory activity, uncoupling proteins, mitochondrial ROS and calcium. An important and still unresolved question is how the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function and the regional specializations of mitochondria are mechanistically realized in the cell and to what extent this could be dependent on environmental aspects. Distinct mitochondrial subsets may also exhibit different responses to substrates and inhibitors and may vary in their sensitivity to pathology, resistance to apoptosis, oxidative stress, thus also demonstrating heterogeneous behavior. All these observations strongly suggest that the intracellular position, organization and the specific surroundings of mitochondria within the cell define their functional features, while also implying that different mitochondrial subpopulations, clusters or even single mitochondrion may execute diverse processes in a cell. The heterogeneity of mitochondrial function demonstrates an additional level of mitochondrial complexity and is a new, challenging area in mitochondrial research that potentially leads to the integration of mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell physiology with various physiological and pathophysiological implications.},

The nucleotide sequence of a 3·2 kb PstI-XhoI fragment complementing a gut2 mutant strain is presented. The fragment reveals an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 68·8 kDa. Disruption of the ORF leads to a glycerol non-utilizing phenotype. A putative flavin-binding domain, located at the amino terminus, was identified by comparison with the amino acid sequences of other flavoproteins. The cloned gene has been mapped both physically and genetically to the left arm of chromosome IX, where the original gut2 mutation also maps. We conclude that the presented ORF is the GUT2 gene and propose that it is the structural gene for the mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.},

Here we show that mutants of the dimer-specific subunits e and g, which destabilize dimeric and oligomeric F1F0-ATP synthase supracomplexes, have a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨ. The degree of destabilization correlated with the reduction of the membrane potential. The enzymatic activities of F1F0-ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase, maximal respiration rate, coupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and tubular mitochondrial morphology were not affected or only to a minor extent. In mutants lacking one or two coiled-coil domains of subunit e, the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential was not due to loss of mitochondrial DNA, a reduced capacity of oxidative phosphorylation, or to altered cristae morphology.

	abstract = {Mitochondria are the site where oxidative phosphorylations (OXPHOSs) take place. Fusion and fission reactions allow them to change their overall morphology, which ranges from networks of elongated and branched filaments to collections of small individual organelles. It is assumed that mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics are linked and that mitochondrial morphology reflects their functional status. This review shows that the links between mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics are complex and that mitochondrial deficiencies are not systematically associated to fragmentation. In mammals, mitochondrial fragmentation is observed upon inhibition of OXPHOS with drugs, but not in most cellular models with OXPHOS deficits of genetic origin. In yeast, mitochondrial biogenesis and filament interconnectivity augment with increasing respiratory capacity, but mutation or inhibition of the respiratory chain does not provoke major morphological changes. Significant structural and morphological alterations appear restricted to mutation of genes involved in assembly or function of the F1F0-ATP-synthase. Finally, ex vivo studies (in mammals) and in vitro studies (in yeast) confirm the essential role of the inner membrane potential for mitochondrial fusion.},

	abstract = {Ageing is not adaptive since it reduces reproductive potential, and the argument that it evolved to provide offspring with living space is hard to sustain for most species. An alternative theory is based on the recognition that the force of natural selection declines with age, since in most environments individuals die from predation, disease or starvation. Ageing could therefore be the combined result of late-expressed deleterious genes which are beyond the reach of effective negative selection. However, this argument is circular, since the concept of 'late expression' itself implies the prior existence of adult age-related physiological processes. Organisms that do not age are essentially in a steady state in which chronologically young and old individuals are physiologically the same. In this situation the synthesis of macromolecules must be sufficiently accurate to prevent error feedback and the development of lethal 'error catastrophes'. This involves the expenditure of energy, which is required for both kinetic proof-reading and other accuracy promoting devices. It may be selectively advantageous for higher organisms to adopt an energy saving strategy of reduced accuracy in somatic cells to accelerate development and reproduction, but the consequence will be eventual deterioration and death. This 'disposable soma' theory of the evolution of ageing also proposes that a high level of accuracy is maintained in immortal germ line cells, or alternatively, that any defective germ cells are eliminated. The evolution of an increase in longevity in mammals may be due to a concomitant reduction in the rates of growth and reproduction and an increase in the accuracy of synthesis of macromolecules. The theory can be tested by measuring accuracy in germ line and somatic cells and also by comparing somatic cells from mammals with different longevities.},

	abstract = {Life is the interplay between structure and energy, yet the role of energy deficiency in human disease has been poorly explored by modern medicine. Since the mitochondria use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to convert dietary calories into usable energy, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a toxic by-product, I hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in a wide range of age-related disorders and various forms of cancer. Because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in thousands of copies per cell and encodes essential genes for energy production, I propose that the delayed-onset and progressive course of the age-related diseases results from the accumulation of somatic mutations in the mtDNAs of post-mitotic tissues. The tissue-specific manifestations of these diseases may result from the varying energetic roles and needs of the different tissues. The variation in the individual and regional predisposition to degenerative diseases and cancer may result from the interaction of modern dietary caloric intake and ancient mitochondrial genetic polymorphisms. Therefore the mitochondria provide a direct link between our environment and our genes and the mtDNA variants that permitted our forbears to energetically adapt to their ancestral homes are influencing our health today.},

A double deletion mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which two essential components of the fission and fusion machinery, Dnm1 and Mgm1, are simultaneously ablated, contain wild-type like filamentous mitochondria, but are characterized by impaired respiration, an increased sensitivity to different stressors, increased mitochondrial protein carbonylation, and a decrease in mitophagy and replicative lifespan.

	abstract = {Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles which are endowed with the ability to change their shape (e.g., by elongation, shortening, branching, buckling, swelling) and their location inside a living cell. In addition they may fuse or divide. These dynamics are discussed. Dislocation of mitochondria may result from their interaction with elements of the cytoskeleton, with microtubules in particular, and from processes intrinsic to the mitochondria themselves. Morphological criteria and differences in the fate of some mitochondria argue for the presence of more than one mitochondrial population in some animal cells. Whether these reflect genetic differences remains obscure. Emphasis is laid on the methods for visualizing mitochondria in cells and following their behaviour. Fluorescence methods provide unique possibilities because of their high resolving power and because some of the mitochondria-specific fluorochromes can be used to reveal the membrane potential. Fusion and fission often occur in short time intervals within the same group of mitochondria. At sites of fusion of two mitochondria material of the inner membrane, the matrix compartment seems to accumulate. The original arrangement of the fusion partners is maintained for some minutes. Fission is a dynamic event which, like fusion, in most cases observed in vertebrate cell cultures is not a straightforward process but rather requires several “trials” until the division finally occurs. Regarding fusion and fission hitherto unpublished phase contrast micrographs, and electron micrographs have been included. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The dimer ribbons enforce a strong local curvature on the membrane with a 17-nm outer radius. Calculations of the electrostatic field strength indicate a significant increase in charge density, and thus in the local pH gradient of ∼0.5 units in regions of high membrane curvature. We conclude that the mitochondrial cristae act as proton traps, and that the proton sink of the ATP synthase at the apex of the compartment favours effective ATP synthesis under proton-limited conditions.

We identified MMR1 as a high-dose suppressor of the myo2 mitochondrial defect and that Mmr1p resides restrictively on the bud-localizing mitochondria and forms a complex with Myo2p tail. Mmr1p loss delayed mitochondrial transfer to buds and completely abolished mitochondrial distribution in the absence of Ypt11p, which promotes mitochondrial distribution by complex formation with Myo2p tail. The myo2-573 mutation, which causes a mitochondrial distribution defect and inactivates the Mmr1p function, reduced association between Myo2p and Mmr1p and depolarized Mmr1p localization on mitochondria. These strongly suggest that Mmr1p is a key mitochondrial component of the link between Myo2p and mitochondria for Myo2p-dependent mitochondrial distribution. Genetical analysis revealed that the Mmr1p-Myo2p pathway is independent of the Ypt11p-Myo2p pathway, suggesting that an essential system for mitochondrial distribution is composed of two independent Myo2p pathways.},

In addition, the functional characterization of a large number of yeast gene products resident in mitochondria has been instrumental for the later identification and characterization of their human orthologs. Here I will review the molecular and biochemical characterization of several mitochondrial diseases that have been ascribed to mutations in genes that were first found in yeast to be necessary for the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.},

Mitochondria have a crucial role in cellular bioenergetics and apoptosis, and thus are important to support cell function and in determination of cell death pathways. Inherited mitochondrial diseases can be caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA or of nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. Although many mitochondrial disorders are multisystemic, some are tissue specific—eg, optic neuropathy, sensorineural deafness, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the past few years, several disorders have been associated with mutations of nuclear genes responsible for mitochondrial DNA maintenance and function, and the potential contribution of mitochondrial abnormalities to progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease has been recognised. The process of mitochondrial fission-fusion has become a focus of attention in human disease. Importantly, the mitochondrion is now a target for therapeutic interventions that encompass small molecules, transcriptional regulation, and genetic manipulation, offering opportunities to treat a diverse range of diseases.},

Our data suggest that MICOS subcomplexes independently localize to cristae junctions and are connected via Mic19, which functions to regulate subcomplex distribution, and thus, potentially also cristae junction copy number. MICOS subunits have non-redundant functions as the absence of both MICOS subcomplexes results in more severe morphological and respiratory growth defects than deletion of single MICOS subunits or subcomplexes. Mitochondrial defects resulting from MICOS loss are caused by misdistribution of respiratory complexes in the inner membrane. Together, our data are consistent with a model where MICOS, mitochondrial lipids and respiratory complexes coordinately build a functional and correctly shaped mitochondrial inner membrane.},

On the contrary, dissolved oxygen concentration (DOC) should be considered as the major factor affecting yeast morphology. Specifically, when growth occurred in low or zero DOC the mycelial and/or pseudomycelial forms predominated over the yeast form independently of the carbon and nitrogen sources used. Experimental data originated from a continuous culture of Y. lipolytica on glycerol, being used as carbon and energy source, demonstrate that transition of mycelium to yeast form occurs when DOC increases from 0.1 mg l-1 to 1.5 mg l-1. DOC affected also the yeast physiology since the activity of enzymes implicated in lipid biosynthesis process (i.e. ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme) was up-regulated at high DOC whereas the activity of enzymes implicated in glycerol assimilation (such as glycerol dehydrogenase and kinase) remained fundamentally unaffected in the cell free extract.},

	abstract = {Yeasts growing limited for nitrogen source or treated with fusel alcohols form elongated cells – pseudohyphae. Absence of mitochondrial DNA or anaerobic conditions inhibits this process, but the precise role of mitochondria is not clear. We found that a significant percentage of pseudohyphal cells contained mitochondria with different levels of membrane potential within one cell. An uncoupler FCCP, but not the ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin D, prevented pseudohyphal growth. Interestingly, repression of the MIH1 gene encoding phosphatase activator of the G2/M transition partially restores the ability of yeast to form pseudohyphal cells in the presence of FCCP or in the absence of mitochondrial DNA. At the same time, retrograde signaling (the one triggered by dysfunctional mitochondria) appeared to be a positive regulator of butanol-induced pseudohyphae formation: the deletion of any of the retrograde signaling genes (RTG1, RTG2, or RTG3) partially suppressed pseudohyphal growth. Together, our data suggests that two subpopulations of mitochondria are required for filamentous growth: one with high and another with low transmembrane potential. These mitochondria activated signaling pathways appear to converge at Mih1p level.© 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved},

Ribosome-like particles were also seen associated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer nuclear membrane. Vacuolar and plasma membranes, however, did not appear to have attached particles.
When incubated in an amino acid-incorporating system containing pH 5 fraction, mitochondria isolated in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ were capable of incorporating [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. About 80 \% of the incorporation was inhibited by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, indicating that the majority of the amino acid-incorporating activity was due to cytoplasmic ribosomes associated with mitochondria. Mitochondria-bound cytoplasmic ribosomes were capable of vectorial release of nascent chains as shown by the distribution of puromycin-discharged polypeptides: half remain associated with the mitochondria and were releaseable by detergent, and half were released directly into the medium. These results are comparable to data reported for the distribution of puromycin-released nascent polypeptide chains with preparations of rough endoplasmic reticulum from rat liver.
About one-third of the mitochondria-associated cytoplasmic ribosomes could be released by incubating mitochondria in a buffer of high ionic strength. The remaining two-thirds, however, were released only after reacting their nascent polypeptide chains with puromycin. This result suggests a role for the nascent polypeptide chains in the attachment of cytoplasmic polysomes to mitochondria. Cytoplasmic polysomes can be released intact from isolated mitochondria by extraction with Triton X-100.},

The reoxidation of cytochrome b5, after exhaustion of NADH, precedes that of cytochrome c. NADH oxidation is blocked by mersalyl, an inhibitor of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. These observations support the view of an electron transfer from the outer to the inner membrane of intact mitochondria. Both the rate of exogenous NADH oxidation and the steady state level of cytochrome c reduction increase with the increase of ionic strength, while the rate of succinate oxidation undergoes a parallel depression. These observations suggest that the functions of cytochrome c as an electron carrier in the inner membrane and as an electron shuttle in the intermembrane space are alternative. It is concluded that aerobic oxidation of exogenous NADH involves the following pathway: NADH leads to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase leads to cytochrome b5 leads to intermembrane cytochrome c leads to cytochrome oxidase leads to oxygen. It is suggested that the communication between the outer and inner membranes mediated by cytochrome c may affect the oxidation-reduction level of cytosolic NADH and the related oxidation-reduction reactions.},

	abstract = {Through genome-wide transcript analysis of a reference strain and two recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with different rates of galactose uptake, we obtained information about the global transcriptional response to metabolic engineering of the GAL gene regulatory network. One of the recombinant strains overexpressed the gene encoding the transcriptional activator Gal4, and in the other strain the genes encoding Gal80, Gal6, and Mig1, which are negative regulators of the GAL system, were deleted. Even though the galactose uptake rates were significantly different in the three strains, we surprisingly did not find any significant changes in the expression of the genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing the first steps of the pathway (i.e., the genes encoding Gal2, Gal1, Gal7, and Gal10). We did, however, find that PGM2, encoding the major isoenzyme of phosphoglucomutase, was slightly up-regulated in the two recombinant strains with higher galactose uptake rates. This indicated that PGM2 is a target for overexpression in terms of increasing the flux through the Leloir pathway, and through overexpression of PGM2 the galactose uptake rate could be increased by 70\% compared to that of the reference strain. Based on our findings, we concluded that phosphoglucomutase plays a key role in controlling the flux through the Leloir pathway, probably due to increased conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate. This conclusion was supported by measurements of sugar phosphates, which showed that there were increased concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate, galactose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate in the strain construct overexpressing PGM2.},

Cross-sectional studies with livers collected from Sod1-/- and age-matched +/+ controls revealed extensive oxidative damage in the cytoplasm and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus and mitochondria from as early as 3 months of age. A marked reduction in cytosolic aconitase, increased levels of 8-oxo dG and F2-isoprostanes, and a moderate reduction in glutathione peroxidase activities and porin levels were observed in all age groups of Sod1-/- mice examined. There were also age-related reductions in Mn superoxide dismutase activities and carbonic anhydrase III. Parallel to the biochemical changes, there were progressive increases in the DNA repair enzyme APEX1, the cell cycle control proteins cyclin D1 and D3, and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met.

By examination of several interacting proteins (Sis1–Sis1, Net1–Sir2, Cet1–Cet1 and Pho2–Pho4), we demonstrate that the BiFC assay can be used to reliably analyse the occurrence and subcellular localization of protein–protein interactions in living yeast cells.

Presynaptic mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, although there is no precise definition of the term ‘dysfunction’. In this study we test the hypothesis that partial restriction of electron transport through Complexes I and II in synaptosomes to mimic possible defects associated with Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases respectively, sensitizes individual terminals to mitochondrial depolarization under conditions of enhanced proton current utilization, even though these stresses are within the respiratory capacity of the synaptosomes when averaged over the entire population. We combine two novel techniques, firstly using a modification of a novel plate-based respiration and glycolysis assay that requires only microgram quantities of synaptosomal protein, and secondly developing an improved method for fluorescent imaging and statistical analysis of single synaptosomes. Conditions are defined for optimal substrate supply to the in situ mitochondria within mouse cerebrocortical synaptosomes, and the energetic demands of ion cycling and action potential firing at the plasma membrane are additionally determined.},

Mutations in the gene encoding OPA1, a protein required for fusion of mitochondria, are associated with hereditary autosomal dominant optic atrophy type I. Here we show that mitochondrial fragmentation correlates with processing of large isoforms of OPA1 in cybrid cells from a patient with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers syndrome and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring an error-prone mitochondrial mtDNA polymerase γ. Furthermore, processed OPA1 was observed in heart tissue derived from heart-specific TFAM knock-out mice suffering from mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and in skeletal muscles from patients suffering from mitochondrial myopathies such as myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to fast induction of proteolytic processing of OPA1 and concomitant fragmentation of mitochondria. Recovery of mitochondrial fusion depended on protein synthesis and was accompanied by resynthesis of large isoforms of OPA1. Fragmentation of mitochondria was prevented by overexpressing OPA1. Taken together, our data indicate that proteolytic processing of OPA1 has a key role in inducing fragmentation of energetically compromised mitochondria. We present the hypothesis that this pathway regulates mitochondrial morphology and serves as an early response to prevent fusion of dysfunctional mitochondria with the functional mitochondrial network.},

	abstract = {A continuous culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 0233, growing with glucose as the major carbon and energy source, shows oscillations of respiration with a period of 48 min. Samples taken at maxima and minima indicate that (i) periodic changes do not occur as a result of carbon depletion, (ii) intrinsic differences in respiratory activity occur in washed organisms and (iii) a respiratory inhibitor accumulates during respiratory oscillations. Plasma membrane and inner mitochondrial membranes generate transmembrane electrochemical potentials; changes in these can be respectively assessed using anionic or cationic fluorophores. Thus flow cytometric analyses indicated that an oxonol dye [DiBAC4(3); bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol] was excluded from yeasts to a similar extent (in {\textgreater}98\% of the population) at all stages, showing that the plasma membrane potential was maintained at a steady value. However, uptake of Rhodamine 123 was greatest at that phase characterized by a low respiratory rate. Addition of uncouplers of energy conservation [CCCP (m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone) or S-13(5-chloro-3-t-butyl-2-chloro-41-nitrosalicylanilide)] to the continuous cultures increased the respiration, but had only a transient effect on the period of the oscillation. Electron microscopy showed changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure during the respiratory oscillation. At low respiration the cristae were more clearly defined due to swelling of the matrix; this corresponds to the ‘orthodox’ conformation. When respiration was high the mitochondrial configuration was ‘condensed’. It has been shown previously that a temperature-compensated ultradian clock operates in S. cerevisiae. It is proposed that mitochondria undergo cycles of energization in response to energetic demands driven by this ultradian clock output.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria have a central role in ageing. They are considered to be both a target of the ageing process and a contributor to it. Alterations in mitochondrial structure and function are evident during ageing in most eukaryotes, but how this occurs is poorly understood. Here we identify a functional link between the lysosome-like vacuole and mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that mitochondrial dysfunction in replicatively aged yeast arises from altered vacuolar pH. We found that vacuolar acidity declines during the early asymmetric divisions of a mother cell, and that preventing this decline suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and extends lifespan. Surprisingly, changes in vacuolar pH do not limit mitochondrial function by disrupting vacuolar protein degradation, but rather by reducing pH-dependent amino acid storage in the vacuolar lumen. We also found that calorie restriction promotes lifespan extension at least in part by increasing vacuolar acidity via conserved nutrient-sensing pathways. Interestingly, although vacuolar acidity is reduced in aged mother cells, acidic vacuoles are regenerated in newborn daughters, coinciding with daughter cells having a renewed lifespan potential. Overall, our results identify vacuolar pH as a critical regulator of ageing and mitochondrial function, and outline a potentially conserved mechanism by which calorie restriction delays the ageing process. Because the functions of the vacuole are highly conserved throughout evolution, we propose that lysosomal pH may modulate mitochondrial function and lifespan in other eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is often required for activation of the caspase proteases that cause apoptotic cell death. Various intermembrane space (IMS) proteins, such as cytochrome c, promote caspase activation following their mitochondrial release. As a consequence, mitochondrial outer membrane integrity is highly controlled, primarily through interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family. Following MOMP by pro-apoptotic BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) or BCL-2 antagonist or killer (BAK), additional regulatory mechanisms govern the mitochondrial release of IMS proteins and caspase activity. MOMP typically leads to cell death irrespective of caspase activity by causing a progressive decline in mitochondrial function, although cells can survive this under certain circumstances, which may have pathophysiological consequences.},

	abstract = {Assembly of mitochondria into networks supports fuel metabolism and calcium transport and is involved in the cellular response to apoptotic stimuli. A mitochondrial network is defined as a continuous matrix lumen whose boundaries limit molecular diffusion. Observation of individual networks has proven challenging in live cells that possess dense populations of mitochondria. Investigation into the electrical and morphological properties of mitochondrial networks has therefore not yielded consistent conclusions. In this study we used matrix-targeted, photoactivatable green fluorescent protein to tag single mitochondrial networks. This approach, coupled with real-time monitoring of mitochondrial membrane potential, permitted the examination of matrix lumen continuity and fusion and fission events over time. We found that adjacent and intertwined mitochondrial structures often represent a collection of distinct networks. We additionally found that all areas of a single network are invariably equipotential, suggesting that a heterogeneous pattern of membrane potential within a cell's mitochondria represents differences between discrete networks. Interestingly, fission events frequently occurred without any gross morphological changes and particularly without fragmentation. These events, which are invisible under standard confocal microscopy, redefine the mitochondrial network boundaries and result in electrically disconnected daughter units.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria undergo fission–fusion events that render these organelles highly dynamic in cells. We report a relationship between mitochondrial form and cell cycle control at the G1–S boundary. Mitochondria convert from isolated, fragmented elements into a hyperfused, giant network at G1–S transition. The network is electrically continuous and has greater ATP output than mitochondria at any other cell cycle stage. Depolarizing mitochondria at early G1 to prevent these changes causes cell cycle progression into S phase to be blocked. Inducing mitochondrial hyperfusion by acute inhibition of dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1) causes quiescent cells maintained without growth factors to begin replicating their DNA and coincides with buildup of cyclin E, the cyclin responsible for G1-to-S phase progression. Prolonged or untimely formation of hyperfused mitochondria, through chronic inhibition of DRP1, causes defects in mitotic chromosome alignment and S-phase entry characteristic of cyclin E overexpression. These findings suggest a hyperfused mitochondrial system with specialized properties at G1–S is linked to cyclin E buildup for regulation of G1-to-S progression.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses image processing techniques and algorithms in the physical context of remote sensing. The chapters also describes tools for spectral and spatial transforms that are useful in the correction and calibration of images for atmospheric and sensor effects. Spectral transformations alter the spectral space and spatial transformations alter the image space. Many of these transformed spaces are useful for thematic classification and are collectively called feature spaces in that context. A variety of spectral transformations are examined, ranging from nonlinear spectral band ratios to linear transformations of various types. Some are designed to improve quantitative analysis of remote-sensing images, while others simply enhance subtle information so that it is visible. The chapter concludes the following points: (1) spectral band ratios can help isolate spectral signatures from imagery by reducing topographic shading; (2) ratios involving near infrared (NIR) and red spectral bands are useful for vegetation measurements; (3) the principal components transform is optimal for data compression, but because it is data dependent, the resulting features have different interpretations for different images; (4) the tasseled-cap transform provides a fixed but sensor-specific transform that is based on soil and vegetation signatures; and (5) color–image composites can be enhanced for visual interpretation by a variety of spectral transforms, however, these transforms are not to be used for quantitative data analysis.},

During the course of studies into the physiology of yeasts, we found that these systems provide a suitable model for the biogenesis and ultrastructure research of microbodies (peroxisomes). Microbodies of hydrocarbon utilizing Candida tropicalis multiply profusely from the preexisting microbody. β oxidation enzymes in the microbody were determined by means of immunoelectron microscopy. We examined the ultrastructure of Candida boidinii microbodies grown on methanol, and found a composite crystalloid of two enzymes, alcohol oxidase and catalase, by analyzing using the optical diffraction and filtering technique and computer simulation. We established methods for preparing the protoplasts of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and conditions for the complete regeneration of the cell wall. The dynamic process of cell wall formation was clarified through our study of the protoplasts, using an improved ultra high resolution (UHR) FESEM S-900 and an S-900LV. It was found that β-1,3-glucan, β-1,6-glucan and α-1,3-glucan, as well as α-galactomannan, are ingredients of the cell wall. The process of septum formation during cell division was examined after cryo-fixation by high pressure freezing (HPF). It was also found that α-1,3- and β-1,3-glucans were located in the invaginating nascent septum, and later, highly branched β-1,6-glucan also appeared on the second septum. The micro-sampling method, using a focused ion beam (FIB), has been applied to our yeast cell wall research. A combination of FIB and scanning transmission electron microscopy is useful in constructing 3D images and analyzing the molecular architecture of cells, as well as for electron tomography of thick sections of biological specimens.},

	abstract = {Increased conversion of glucose to lactic acid associated with decreased mitochondrial respiration is a unique feature of tumors first described by Otto Warburg in the 1920s. Recent evidence suggests that the Warburg effect is caused by oncogenes and is an underlying mechanism of malignant transformation. Using a novel approach to measure cellular metabolic rates in vitro, the bioenergetic basis of this increased glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial respiration was investigated in two human cancer cell lines, H460 and A549. The bioenergetic phenotype was analyzed by measuring cellular respiration, glycolysis rate, and ATP turnover of the cells in response to various pharmacological modulators. H460 and A549 cells displayed a dependency on glycolysis and an ability to significantly upregulate this pathway when their respiration was inhibited. The converse, however, was not true. The cell lines were attenuated in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and were unable to sufficiently upregulate mitochondrial OXPHOS when glycolysis was disabled. This observed mitochondrial impairment was intimately linked to the increased dependency on glycolysis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that H460 cells were more glycolytic, having a greater impairment of mitochondrial respiration, compared with A549 cells. Finally, the upregulation of glycolysis in response to mitochondrial ATP synthesis inhibition was dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase activity. In summary, our results demonstrate a bioenergetic phenotype of these two cancer cell lines characterized by increased rate of glycolysis and a linked attenuation in their OXPHOS capacity. These metabolic alterations provide a mechanistic explanation for the growth advantage and apoptotic resistance of tumor cells.},

We have used quantitative immunoelectron microscopy to determine the distribution of a collection of representative proteins in yeast mitochondria belonging to seven major processes: oxidative phosphorylation, protein translocation, metabolite exchange, mitochondrial morphology, protein translation, iron–sulfur biogenesis, and protein degradation. We show that proteins are distributed in an uneven, yet not exclusive, manner between IBM and CM. The individual distributions reflect the physiological functions of proteins. Moreover, proteins can redistribute between the domains upon changes of the physiological state of the cell. Impairing assembly of complex III affects the distribution of partially assembled subunits.

	abstract = {Yeast mitochondria (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contain a permeability transition pore which is regulated differently than the pore in mammalian mitochondria. In a mannitol medium containing 10 mm Pi and ethanol (oxidizable substrate), yeast mitochondria accumulate large amounts of Ca2+ ({\textgreater}400 nmol/mg of protein) upon the addition of an electrophoretic Ca2+ ionophore (ETH129). Pore opening does not occur following Ca2+ uptake, even though ruthenium red-inhibited rat liver mitochondria undergo rapid pore opening under analogous conditions. However, a pore does arise in yeast mitochondria when Ca2+ and Pi are not present, as monitored by swelling, ultrastructure, and matrix solute release. Pore opening is slow unless a respiratory substrate is provided (ethanol or NADH) but also occurs rapidly in response to ATP (2 mm) when oligomycin is present. Pi and ADP inhibit pore opening (EC50 ∼1 and 4 mm, respectively), however, cyclosporin A (7 μg/ml), oligomycin (20 μg/ml), or carboxyatractyloside (25 μm) have no effect. The pore arising during respiration is also inhibited by nigericin or uncoupler, indicating that an acidic matrix pH antagonizes the process. Pi also inhibits pore opening by lowering the matrix pH (Pi/OH− antiport). However, inhibition of the ATP-induced pore by Pi is seen in the presence of mersalyl, suggesting a second mechanism of action. Since pore induction by ATP is not sensitive to carboxyatractyloside, ATP appears to act at an external site and Pi may antagonize the interaction. Isoosmotic polyethylene glycol-induced contraction of yeast mitochondria swollen during respiration, or in the presence of ATP, is 50\% effective at a solute size of 1.0–1.1 kDa. This suggests that the same pore is induced in both cases and is comparable in size with the permeability transition pore of heart and liver mitochondria.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial morphology and function are coupled in healthy cells, during pathological conditions and (adaptation to) endogenous and exogenous stress. In this sense mitochondrial shape can range from small globular compartments to complex filamentous networks, even within the same cell. Understanding how mitochondrial morphological changes (i.e. “mitochondrial dynamics”) are linked to cellular (patho) physiology is currently the subject of intense study and requires detailed quantitative information. During the last decade, various computational approaches have been developed for automated 2-dimensional (2D) analysis of mitochondrial morphology and number in microscopy images. Although these strategies are well suited for analysis of adhering cells with a flat morphology they are not applicable for thicker cells, which require a three-dimensional (3D) image acquisition and analysis procedure. Here we developed and validated an automated image analysis algorithm allowing simultaneous 3D quantification of mitochondrial morphology and network properties in human endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cells expressing a mitochondria-targeted green fluorescence protein (mitoGFP) were visualized by 3D confocal microscopy and mitochondrial morphology was quantified using both the established 2D method and the new 3D strategy. We demonstrate that both analyses can be used to characterize and discriminate between various mitochondrial morphologies and network properties. However, the results from 2D and 3D analysis were not equivalent when filamentous mitochondria in normal HUVECs were compared with circular/spherical mitochondria in metabolically stressed HUVECs treated with rotenone (ROT). 2D quantification suggested that metabolic stress induced mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of biomass. In contrast, 3D analysis revealed that the mitochondrial network structure was dissolved without affecting the amount and size of the organelles. Thus, our results demonstrate that 3D imaging and quantification are crucial for proper understanding of mitochondrial shape and topology in non-flat cells. In summary, we here present an integrative method for unbiased 3D quantification of mitochondrial shape and network properties in mammalian cells.},

	abstract = {Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are mitochondrial inner membrane proteins sustaining an inducible proton conductance. They weaken the proton electrochemical gradient built up by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Brown fat UCP1 sustains a free fatty acid (FA)-induced purine nucleotide (PN)-inhibited proton conductance. Inhibition of the proton conductance by PN has been considered as a diagnostic of UCP activity. However, conflicting results have been obtained in isolated mitochondria for UCP homologues (i.e., UCP2, UCP3, plant UCP, and protist UCP) where the FFA-activated proton conductance is poorly sensitive to PN under resting respiration conditions. Our recent work clearly indicates that the membranous coenzyme Q, through its redox state, represents a regulator of the inhibition by PN of FFA-activated UCP1 homologues under phosphorylating respiration conditions. Several physiological roles of UCPs have been suggested, including a control of the cellular energy balance as well as the preventive action against oxidative stress. In this paper, we discuss new information emerging from comparative proteomics about the impact of UCPs on mitochondrial physiology, when recombinant UCP1 is expressed in yeast and when UCP2 is over-expressed in hepatic mitochondria during steatosis.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria are ubiquitous organelles that are intimately involved in many cellular processes, but whose principal task is to provide the energy necessary for normal cell functioning and maintenance. Disruption of this energy supply can have devastating consequences for the cell, organ, and individual. Over the last two decades, mutations in both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA have been identified as causative in a number of well‐characterized clinical syndromes, although for mtDNA mutations in particular, this relationship between genotype and phenotype is often not straightforward. Despite this, a number of epidemiological studies have been undertaken to assess the prevalence of mtDNA mutations and these have highlighted the impact that mtDNA disease has on both the community and individual families. Although there has been considerable improvement in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders, disappointingly this has not been matched by developments toward effective treatment. Nevertheless, our understanding of mitochondrial biology is gathering pace and progress in this area will be crucial to devising future treatment strategies. In addition to mitochondrial disease, evidence for a central role of mitochondria in other processes, such as aging and neurodegeneration, is slowly accumulating, although their role in cancer remains controversial. In this chapter, we discuss these issues and offer our own views based on our cumulative experience of investigating and managing these diseases over the last 20 years. © 2007, Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Living yeast cells can be selectively stained with the lipophilic cationic cyanine dye DiOC6(3) in a mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent manner. Our study extends the use of flow cytometric analysis and sorting to DiOC6(3)-stained yeast cells. Experimental conditions were developed that prevented the toxic side effect of the probe and gave a quantitative correlation between fluorescence and mitochondrial membrane potential, without any staining of other membranes. The localization of the fluorochrome was checked by confocal microscopy and image cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane alterations were also tested through cardiolipin staining with nonyl acridine orange. Differences in light scattering and in fluorescence were detected in mutants (rho−, rho°, mit−, or pet−) and wild-type (rho+ mit+) populations of yeast. The dye uptake of respiratory-deficient yeast strains was significantly reduced as compared to that of the wild-type. Application of an uncoupler (mClCCP), which collapsed the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), led to a drastic reduction of the dye uptake. It was observed that a decrease in Δ Ψm was usually correlated with a decrease in cardiolipin stainability by nonyl acridine orange (NAO). Quantitative flow cytometry is a fast and reproducible technique for rapid screening of yeast strains that might be suspected of respiratory dysfunction and/or mitochondrial structural changes. We give evidence that it is an adequate method to characterize and isolate respiratory mutants through sorting procedure, with selective enrichment of the population studied in respiring or nonrespiring yeast cells. Confocal microscopy and image cytometry corroborate the flow cytometry results. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Ultrastructural analyses of cytoplasmic changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180-1A (MATa) that had been treated with alpha factor were performed by using the freeze-substitution fixation method. After alpha factor treatment, cells exhibited a pointed projection, which is a unique pattern of oriented cell surface growth. The relationship between projection formation and intracellular organelles was examined using serial thin sections and computer-aided three-dimensional reconstructions. Using these analyses membrane vesicles and other organelles were detected, and studies on their dynamic structural reorganization became feasible. Production of membrane vesicles (average 65 nm in diameter) was induced upon exposure of the cells to alpha factor before projection emergence. The total number of membrane vesicles increased at the early stage and decreased at the late stage of projection formation. Three-dimensional analysis indicated that the vesicles were at first dispersed throughout the cell, then accumulated at the site where the projection formed. Morphological changes and multiplication of the Golgi body were seen during the process of projection formation. Other intracellular organelles (nucleus, vacuole, rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria) were also rearranged, showing a polar organization of the cytoplasm during projection formation.},

	abstract = {Author SummaryMitochondria are organelles that play a central role as ‘cellular power plants’. The cellular organization of these organelles involves a dynamic spatial network where mitochondria constantly undergo fusion and fission associated with the mixing of their molecular content. Together with the processes of mitophagy and biogenesis of mitochondrial mass, this results into a cellular surveillance system for maintaining their bioenergetic quality. The accumulation of molecular damage in mitochondria is associated with various human disorders and with aging. However, how these processes affect aging and how they can be reconciled with existing aging theories is just at the beginning to be considered. Mathematical modeling allows simulating the dynamics of mitochondrial quality control during aging in silico and leads to the ‘mitochondrial infectious damage adaptation’ (MIDA) model of aging. It reconciles a number of counterintuitive observations obtained during the last decade including infection-like processes of molecular damage spread, the reduction of fusion and fission rates during cellular aging, and observed life span extension for reduced mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, the MIDA model suggests that a reduction in mitochondrial dynamics rather than being merely a sign or even cause of aging, may actually reflect a systemic adaptation to prolong organismic life span.},

	abstract = {Aerobic chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were performed under carbon-, nitrogen-, and dual carbon- and nitrogen-limiting conditions. The glucose concentration was kept constant, whereas the ammonium concentration was varied among different experiments and different dilution rates. It was found that both glucose and ammonium were consumed at the maximal possible rate, i.e., the feed rate, over a range of medium C/N ratios and dilution rates. To a small extent, this was due to a changing biomass composition, but much more important was the ability of uncoupling between anabolic biomass formation and catabolic energy substrate consumption. When ammonium started to limit the amount of biomass formed and hence the anabolic flow of glucose, this was totally or at least partly compensated for by an increased catabolic glucose consumption. The primary response when glucose was present in excess of the minimum requirements for biomass production was an increased rate of respiration. The calculated specific oxygen consumption rate, at D = 0.07 h-1, was more than doubled when an additional nitrogen limitation was imposed on the cells compared with that during single glucose limitation. However, the maximum respiratory capacity decreased with decreasing nitrogen concentration. The saturation level of the specific oxygen consumption rate decreased from 5.5 to 6.0 mmol/g/h under single glucose limitation to about 4.0 mmol/g/h at the lowest nitrogen concentration tested. The combined result of this was that the critical dilution rate, i.e., onset of fermentation, was as low as 0.10 h-1 during growth in a medium with a low nitrogen concentration compared with 0.20 h-1 obtained under single glucose limitation.},

It has been found that this yeast has a permeability for glycerol and other three carbon compounds much greater than that of baker's yeast. This permeability allows the entrance of glycerol in Candida cells rapidly enough to permit its efficient utilization even at low concentrations. The inducibility of glycerol kinase has been established. An increase in the concentration of the mitochondrial L-α-glycerophosphate oxidase when the yeast is grown on glycerol has also been observed. A model is presented for the substrate specificity pattern of glycerol kinase of C. mycoderma. It postulates the involvement of three hydroxyl groups in the spatial distribution corresponding to the formation of L-α-glycerophosphate from glycerol. This requirement can be met by aldo-and ketotrioses in their respective hydrated forms. The pathway of glycerol formation in S. cerevisiae has also been studied. Evidence is shown of the existence of a NADH dependent enzymatic activity reducing triose phosphate to α-glycerophosphate which can roughly account for the glycerol production. A low ionic strength seems to be required for the activity of this enzyme. The α-glycerophosphatase is specific for the L from, the efficiency of α-glycerophosphatase on D-α-glycerophosphate being 1/30 of that on L-α-glycerophosphate. The concentration of the α-glycerophosphatase in yeasts is higher when grown on hexoses than when grown on non-sugar carbon sources.},

	abstract = {Maintenance of a cytoplasmic redox balance is a necessity for sustained cellular metabolism. Glycerol formation is the only way by which Saccharomyces cerevisiae can maintain this balance under anaerobic conditions. Aerobically, on the other hand, several different redox adjustment mechanisms exist, one of these being the glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) shuttle. We have studied the importance of this shuttle under aerobic conditions by comparing growth properties and glycerol formation of a wild-type strain with that of gut2Δ mutants, lacking the FAD-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, assuming that the consequent blocking of G3P oxidation is forcing the cells to produce glycerol from G3P. To impose different demands on the redox adjustment capability we used various carbon sources having different degrees of reduction. The results showed that the shuttle was used extensively with reduced substrate such as ethanol, whereas the more oxidized substrates lactate and pyruvate, did not provoke any activity of the shuttle. However, the absence of a functional G3P shuttle did not affect the growth rate or growth yield of the cells, not even during growth on ethanol. Presumably, there must be alternative systems for maintaining a cytoplasmic redox balance, e.g. the so-called external NADH dehydrogenase, located on the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. By comparing the performance of the external NADH dehydrogenase and the G3P shuttle in isolated mitochondria, it was found that the former resulted in high respiratory rates but a comparably low P/O ratio of 1·2, whereas the shuttle gave low rates but a high P/O ratio of 1·7. Our results also demonstrated that of the two isoforms of NAD-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, only the enzyme encoded by GPD1 appeared important for the shuttle, since the enhanced glycerol production that occurs in a gut2Δ strain proved dependent on GPD1 but not on GPD2. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We hypothesize that the division cycle machinery has a limited zone of influence in the cytoplasm to promote nuclear autonomy. Mitochondria in cultured mammalian cells undergo cell cycle-specific changes in morphology and membrane potential and therefore can serve as a reporter of the cell cycle state of the cytoplasm. To evaluate if the cell cycle state of nuclei in A. gossypii can influence the adjacent cytoplasm, we tested whether local mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in A. gossypii are associated with the division state of a nearby nucleus. We found that mitochondria exhibit substantial heterogeneity in both morphology and membrane potential within a single multinucleated cell. Notably, differences in mitochondrial morphology or potential are not associated with a specific nuclear division state. Heterokaryon mutants with a mixture of nuclei with deletions of and wild type for the mitochondrial fusion/fission genes DNM1 and FZO1 exhibit altered mitochondrial morphology and severe growth and sporulation defects. This dominant effect suggests that the gene products may be required locally near their expression site rather than diffusing widely in the cell. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial dynamics are essential in these large syncytial cells, yet morphology and membrane potential are independent of nuclear cycle state.},

Increasing cellular glucose uptake is a fundamental concept in treatment of type 2 diabetes, whereas nutritive calorie restriction increases life expectancy. We show here that increased glucose availability decreases Caenorhabditis elegans life span, while impaired glucose metabolism extends life expectancy by inducing mitochondrial respiration. The histone deacetylase Sir2.1 is found here to be dispensable for this phenotype, whereas disruption of aak-2, a homolog of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK), abolishes extension of life span due to impaired glycolysis. Reduced glucose availability promotes formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces catalase activity, and increases oxidative stress resistance and survival rates, altogether providing direct evidence for a hitherto hypothetical concept named mitochondrial hormesis or “mitohormesis.” Accordingly, treatment of nematodes with different antioxidants and vitamins prevents extension of life span. In summary, these data indicate that glucose restriction promotes mitochondrial metabolism, causing increased ROS formation and cumulating in hormetic extension of life span, questioning current treatments of type 2 diabetes as well as the widespread use of antioxidant supplements.},

In addition to complete fusion, we observed transient fusion events, wherein two mitochondria came into close apposition, exchanged soluble inter-membrane space and matrix proteins, and re-separated, preserving the original morphology. Transient fusion exhibited rapid kinetics of the sequential and separable mergers of the outer and inner membranes, but allowed only partial exchange of integral membrane proteins. When the inner membrane fusion protein Opa1 level was lowered or was greatly elevated, transient fusions could occur, whereas complete fusions disappeared. Furthermore, transient fusions began from oblique or lateral interactions of mitochondria associated with separate microtubules, whereas complete fusions resulted from longitudinal merging of organelles travelling along a single microtubule. In contrast to complete fusion, transient fusions both required and promoted mitochondrial motility. Transient fusions were also necessary and sufficient to support mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, Opa1 expression and cytoskeletal anchorage govern a novel form of fusion that has a distinct function in mitochondrial maintenance.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of Alzheimer disease (AD) neurons. In this study, we explored the involvement of an abnormal mitochondrial dynamics by investigating the changes in the expression of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins in AD brain and the potential cause and consequence of these changes in neuronal cells. We found that mitochondria were redistributed away from axons in the pyramidal neurons of AD brain. Immunoblot analysis revealed that levels of DLP1 (also referred to as Drp1), OPA1, Mfn1, and Mfn2 were significantly reduced while levels of Fis1 were significantly increased in AD. Despite their differential effects on mitochondrial morphology, manipulations of these mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins in neuronal cells to mimic their expressional changes in AD, caused a similar abnormal mitochondrial distribution pattern, such that mitochondrial density was reduced in the cell periphery of M17 cells or neuronal process of primary neurons and correlated with reduced spine density in the neurite. Interestingly, oligomeric amyloid-β-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) caused mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced mitochondrial density in neuronal processes. More importantly, ADDL-induced synaptic change (i.e., loss of dendritic spine and PSD-95 puncta) correlated with abnormal mitochondrial distribution. DLP1 overexpression, likely through repopulation of neuronal processes with mitochondria, prevented ADDLs-induced synaptic loss, suggesting that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics plays an important role in ADDLs-induced synaptic abnormalities. Based on these findings, we suggest that an altered balance in mitochondrial fission and fusion is likely an important mechanism leading to mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction in AD brain.},

We show that all cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is bound to cytochrome c reductase (complex III), which exists in three forms: the free dimer, and two supercomplexes comprising an additional one or two complex IV monomers. The distribution between these forms varies with growth conditions. In mammalian mitochondria, almost all complex I is assembled into supercomplexes comprising complexes I and III and up to four copies of complex IV, which guided us to present a model for a network of respiratory chain complexes: a ‘respirasome’.

	abstract = {A mitochondrial NADH: Q6 oxidoreductase has been isolated from cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a simple method involving extraction of the enzyme from the mitochondrial membrane with Triton X-100, followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and blue Sepharose CL-6B. By this procedure a 2000-fold purification is achieved with respect to whole cells or a 150-fold purification with respect to the mitochondrion. The purified NADH dehydrogenase consists of a single subunit with molecular mass of 53 kDa as indicated by SDS/poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme contains FAD, non-covalently linked, as the sole prosthetic group with Em,7.67.6 = -370 mV and no iron-sulphur clusters. The enzyme is specific for NADH with apparent Km= 31 μM and was found to be inhibited by flavone (I50= 95 mUM), but not by rotenone or piericidin. The purified enzyme can use ubiquinone-2, -6 or -10, menaquinone, dichloroindophenol or ferricyanide as electron acceptors, but at different rates. The greatest turnover of NADH was obtained with ubiquinone-2 as acceptor (2500 s−1). With the natural ubiquinone-6 this value was 500s-1. The NADH:Q2 oxidoreductase activity shows a maximum at pH 6.2, the NADH:Q6 oxidoreductase activity is constant between pH 4.5-9.0. The amount of enzyme in the cell is subject to glucose repression: it increases slightly when cells, grown on glucose or lactate, enter the stationary phase. The experiments performed so far suggest that the enzyme purified in this study is the external NADH:Q6 oxidoreductase, bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane and that it is involved in the oxidation of cytosolic NADH. The relation of this enzyme with respect to various other NADH dehydrogenases from yeast and plant mitochondria is discussed.},

The NDI1-overexpressed membranes showed significantly increased activities of NADH oxidase and NADH-ubiquinone-1 (UQ1) reductase when compared with the control membranes. Flavone, which is a specific inhibitor of the S. cerevisiae NDI1, inhibited almost completely NADH oxidase and NADH-UQ1 reductase activities of NDI1-overexpressed membranes but scarcely inhibited these activities of the control membranes. In addition, the NADH oxidase activity of the NDI1-overexpressed membranes was also inhibited by KCN as well as the control membranes. These results indicate that the overexpressed NDI1 worked as a member of the respiratory chain in the host cells, even though E. coli membranes are different from S. cerevisiae inner mitochondrial membranes in terms of quinones and lipid composition.},

Here, the measure of the life span is the number of generations or divisions the yeast cell has undergone. The yeast cell is the organism, simplifying many aspects of aging research. Most importantly, the genetics of yeast is highly-developed and readily applicable to the dissection of longevity. Two candidate longevity genes have already been identified and are being characterized. Others will follow through the utilization of both the primary phenotype and the secondary phenotypes associated with aging in yeast. An ontogenetic theory of longevity that follows from the evolutionary biology of aging is put forward in this article. This theory has at its foundation the asymmetric reproduction of cells and organisms, and it makes specific predictions regarding the genetics, molecular mechanisms, and phenotypic features of longevity and senescence, including these: GTP-binding proteins will frequently be involved in determining longevity, asymmetric cell division will be often encountered during embryogenesis while binary fission will be more characteristic of somatic cell division, tumor cells of somatic origin will not be totipotent, and organisms that reproduce symmetrically will not have intrinsic limits to their longevity.},

	abstract = {Recent imaging studies of mitochondrial dynamics have implicated a cycle of fusion, fission, and autophagy in the quality control of mitochondrial function by selectively increasing the membrane potential of some mitochondria at the expense of the turnover of others. This complex, dynamical system creates spatially distributed networks that are dependent on active transport along cytoskeletal networks and on protein import leading to biogenesis. To study the relative impacts of local interactions between neighboring mitochondria and their reorganization via transport, we have developed a spatiotemporal mathematical model encompassing all of these processes in which we focus on the dynamics of a health parameter meant to mimic the functional state of mitochondria. In agreement with previous models, we show that both autophagy and the generation of membrane potential asymmetry following a fusion/fission cycle are required for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population. This health maintenance is affected by mitochondrial density and motility primarily through changes in the frequency of fusion events. Health is optimized when the selectivity thresholds for fusion and fission are matched, providing a mechanistic basis for the observed coupling of the two processes through the protein OPA1. We also demonstrate that the discreteness of the components exchanged during fusion is critical for quality control, and that the effects of limiting total amounts of autophagy and biogenesis have distinct consequences on health and population size, respectively. Taken together, our results show that several general principles emerge from the complexity of the quality control cycle that can be used to focus and interpret future experimental studies, and our modeling framework provides a road-map for deconstructing the functional importance of local interactions in communities of cells as well as organelles., Mitochondria are the powerhouses of eukaryotic cells, oxidizing glucose to produce ATP. Most cells harbor tens to hundreds of mitochondria in a constant state of flux, in which they fuse with one another, undergo fission, import proteins to grow larger, and eventually are recycled by autophagy. These dynamic processes depend on the electrical potential that is maintained across the mitochondrial inner membrane and powers the production of both ATP and detrimental reactive oxygen species. How do mitochondria maintain high membrane potential in the face of damage due to reactive oxygen species? Here, we develop a model to study how the reorganization of mitochondrial networks in space and time due to fusion, fission, and the experimentally observed development of membrane potential asymmetry after fission affect overall mitochondrial health. We show that health, which is a proxy for the mitochondrial membrane potential, is dominated by how density and motility affect the frequency of fusion events, and that several simple rules for the system kinetics lead to optimal quality control. This model predicts general behaviors that can be applied to specific studies of mitochondrial dynamics in a wide variety of cell types, and provides a framework for deconstructing complex organellar organization and their function in human disease.},

	abstract = {The obligate aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is introduced as a powerful new model for the structural and functional analysis of mitochondrial complex I. A brief introduction into the biology and the genetics of this nonconventional yeast is given and the relevant genetic tools that have been developed in recent years are summarized. The respiratory chain of Y. lipolytica contains complexes I-IV, one "alternative" NADH-dehydrogenase (NDH2) and a non-heme alternative oxidase (AOX). Because the NADH binding site of NDH2 faces the mitochondrial intermembrane space rather than the matrix, complex I is an essential enzyme in Y. lipolytica. Nevertheless, complex I deletion strains could be generated by attaching the targeting sequence of a matrix protein, thereby redirecting NDH2 to the matrix side. Deletion strains for several complex I subunits have been constructed that can be complemented by shuttle plasmids carrying the deleted gene. Attachment of a hexa-histidine tag to the NUGM (30 kDa) subunit allows fast and efficient purification of complex I from Y. lipolytica by affinity-chromatography. The purified complex has lost most of its NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, but is almost fully reactivated by adding 400-500 molecules of phosphatidylcholine per complex I. The established set of genetic tools has proven useful for the site-directed mutagenesis of individual subunits of Y. lipolytica complex I. Characterization of a number of mutations already allowed for the identification of several functionally important amino acids, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach.},

Examination of the correlation between the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) structure and mitochondrial energetic function is critical to an understanding of the links between meso-scale morphology and function in progressive mitochondrial dysfunction such as aging, neurodegeneration, and disease. To investigate this relationship, we develop a model to examine the effects of three-dimensional IMM morphology on the electrochemical potential of mitochondria. The 2D axisymmetric finite element method is used to simulate mitochondrial electric potential and proton concentration distribution. This simulation model demonstrates that the proton motive force (PMF) produced on the membranes of cristae can be higher than that on the inner boundary membrane. The model also shows that high proton concentration in cristae can be induced by the morphology-dependent electric potential gradient along the outer side of the IMM. Furthermore, simulation results show that a high PMF is induced by the large surface-to-volume ratio of an individual crista, whereas a high capacity for ATP synthesis can primarily be achieved by increasing the surface area of an individual crista. The mathematical model presented here provides compelling support for the idea that morphology at the meso-scale is a significant driver of mitochondrial function.},

The inner membrane invaginations called cristae are pleomorphic, typically connected by narrow tubular junctions of variable length to the inner boundary membrane. This design may restrict intra-mitochondrial diffusion of metabolites such as ADP, and of soluble proteins such as cytochrome c. Tomographic images of a variety of mitochondria suggest that inner membrane topology reflects a balance between membrane fusion and fission. Proteins that can affect cristae morphology include tBid, which triggers cytochrome c release in apoptosis, and the dynamin-like protein Mgm1, involved in inter-mitochondrial membrane fusion. In frozen-hydrated rat-liver mitochondria, the space between the inner and outer membranes contains 10–15 nm particles that may represent macromolecular complexes involved in activities that span the two membranes.},

	abstract = {Contrary to general concepts of bacterial saccharide metabolism, melibiose (25 to 32 g/liter) and fructose (5 to 14 g/liter) accumulated as extracellular intermediates during the catabolism of raffinose (O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-1, 6-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-fructofuranoside) (90 g/liter) by ethanologenic recombinants of Escherichia coli B, Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1, and Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16. Both hydrolysis products (melibiose and fructose) were subsequently transported and further metabolized by all three organisms. Raffinose catabolism was initiated by beta-fructosidase; melibiose was subsequently hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose by alpha-galactosidase. Glucose and fructose were completely metabolized by all three organisms, but galactose accumulated in the fermentation broth with EC16(pLOI555) and P2. MM2 (a raffinose-positive E. coli mutant) was the most effective biocatalyst for ethanol production (38 g/liter) from raffinose. All organisms rapidly fermented sucrose (90 g/liter) to ethanol (48 g/liter) at more than 90\% of the theoretical yield. During sucrose catabolism, both hydrolysis products (glucose and fructose) were metabolized concurrently by EC16(pLOI555) and P2 without sugar leakage. However, fructose accumulated extracellularly (27 to 28 g/liter) at early stages of fermentation with KO11 and MM2. Sequential utilization of glucose and fructose correlated with a diauxie in base utilization (pH maintenance). The mechanism of sugar escape remains unknown but may involve downhill leakage via permease which transports precursor saccharides or novel sugar export proteins. If sugar escape occurs in nature with wild organisms, it could facilitate the development of complex bacterial communities which are based on the sequence of saccharide catabolism and the hierarchy of sugar utilization.},

	abstract = {The dendritic trees of hippocampal pyramidal cells play important roles in the establishment and regulation of network connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and firing dynamics. Several laboratories routinely reconstruct CA3 and CA1 dendrites to correlate their three-dimensional structure with biophysical, electrophysiological, and anatomical observables. To integrate and assess the consistency of the quantitative data available to the scientific community, we exhaustively analyzed 143 completely reconstructed neurons intracellularly filled and digitized in five different laboratories from 10 experimental conditions. Thirty morphometric parameters, including the most common neuroanatomical measurements, were extracted from all neurons. A consistent fraction of parameters (11 of 30) was significantly different between CA3 and CA1 cells. A considerably large number of parameters was also found that discriminated among neurons within the same morphological class, but reconstructed in different laboratories. These interlaboratory differences (8 of 30 parameters) far outweighed the differences between experimental conditions within a single lab, such as aging or preparation method (at most two significant parameters). The set of morphometrics separating anatomical regions and that separating reconstructing laboratories were almost entirely nonoverlapping. CA3 and CA1 neurons could be distinguished by global quantities such as branch order and Sholl distance. Differences among laboratories were largely due to local variables such as branch diameter and local bifurcation angles. Only one parameter (a ratio of branch diameters) separated both morphological classes and reconstructing laboratories. Compartmental simulations of electrophysiological activity showed that both differences between anatomical classes and reconstructing laboratories could dramatically affect the firing rate of these neurons under different experimental conditions.

	abstract = {Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most prevalent hereditary optic neuropathy resulting in progressive loss of visual acuity, centrocoecal scotoma and bilateral temporal atrophy of the optic nerve with an onset within the first two decades of life. The predominant locus for this disorder (OPA1; MIM 165500) has been mapped to a 1.4-cM interval on chromosome 3q28-q29 flanked by markers D3S3669 and D3S3562 (ref. 3). We established a PAC contig covering the entire OPA1 candidate region of approximately 1 Mb and a sequence skimming approach allowed us to identify a gene encoding a polypeptide of 960 amino acids with homology to dynamin-related GTPases. The gene comprises 28 coding exons and spans more than 40 kb of genomic sequence. Upon sequence analysis, we identified mutations in seven independent families with ADOA. The mutations include missense and nonsense alterations, deletions and insertions, which all segregate with the disease in these families. Because most mutations probably represent null alleles, dominant inheritance of the disease may result from haploinsufficiency of OPA1. OPA1 is widely expressed and is most abundant in the retina. The presence of consensus signal peptide sequences suggests that the product of the gene OPA1 is targeted to mitochondria and may exert its function in mitochondrial biogenesis and stabilization of mitochondrial membrane integrity.},

We show that a cytosolic factor, pyruvate decarboxylase, is required for the non-malate-dependent oxidation of pyruvate by mitochondria. In pyruvate decarboxylase-negative mutants, the oxidation of pyruvate by permeabilized spheroplasts was abolished. In contrast, deletion of the gene (PDA1) encoding the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase did not affect the spheroplast respiratory rate on pyruvate but abolished the malate-dependent respiration of isolated mitochondria. Mutants disrupted for the mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALD7) did not oxidize pyruvate unless malate was added. We therefore propose the existence of a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass different from the cytosolic one, where pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde in the cytosol by pyruvate decarboxylase and then oxidized by mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. This pathway can compensatePDA1 gene deletion for lactate or respiratory glucose growth. However, the codisruption of PDA1 andALD7 genes prevented the growth on lactate, indicating that each of these pathways contributes to the oxidative metabolism of pyruvate.},

Paradoxically, cells invest many resources to maintain tubular mitochondrial morphology, when reducing both fusion and fission simultaneously achieves the same end. This observation suggests a requirement for mitochondrial fusion, beyond maintenance of organelle morphology. Here, we show that cells with targeted null mutations in Mfn1 or Mfn2 retained low levels of mitochondrial fusion and escaped major cellular dysfunction. Analysis of these mutant cells showed that both homotypic and heterotypic interactions of Mfns are capable of fusion. In contrast, cells lacking both Mfn1 and Mfn2 completely lacked mitochondrial fusion and showed severe cellular defects, including poor cell growth, widespread heterogeneity of mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased cellular respiration. Disruption of OPA1 by RNAi also blocked all mitochondrial fusion and resulted in similar cellular defects. These defects in Mfn-null or OPA1-RNAi mammalian cells were corrected upon restoration of mitochondrial fusion, unlike the irreversible defects found in fzoΔ yeast. In contrast, fragmentation of mitochondria, without severe loss of fusion, did not result in such cellular defects. Our results showed that key cellular functions decline as mitochondrial fusion is progressively abrogated.},

However, little is known about what triggers these modifications and whether or not they are physiologically reversible. We hypothesized that energy substrate availability could play an important role in this phenomenon. The physiological effects of a change in substrate availability were examined on a human cancer cell line (HeLa), focusing specifically on its ability to use glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation, and the effect that energy substrate type has on mitochondrial composition, structure, and function. Changes in oxidative phosphorylation were measured in vivo by a variety of techniques, including the use of two novel ratiometric green fluorescent protein biosensors, the expression level of oxidative phosphorylation and some glycolytic enzymes were determined by Western blot, mitochondrial DNA content was measured by real-time PCR, and mitochondrial morphology was monitored by both confocal and electron microscopy. Our data show that the defective mitochondrial system described in cancer cells can be dramatically improved by solely changing substrate availability and that HeLa cells can adapt their mitochondrial network structurally and functionally to derive energy by glutaminolysis only. This could also provide an explanation for the enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation capacity observed after tumor regression or removal. Our work demonstrates that the pleomorphic, highly dynamic structure of the mitochondrion can be remodeled to accommodate a change in oxidative phosphorylation activity. We compared our finding on HeLa cells with those for nontransformed fibroblasts to help distinguish the regulatory pathways.},

Mitochondria generate most of the energy used by cells, and they also play key roles in cellular growth, death, and differentiation. They are evolutionarily derived from bacteria and have retained their own DNA and protein translation system, but they are also dependent on the cell for their growth and replication.
A significant portion of the outer membrane of a mitochondrion is in contact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—an organelle that is the starting point for the synthesis of secreted proteins, and is also critical for the synthesis of lipids and other organelles. Recent work suggests that mitochondria–ER contact points mark sites of mitochondrial division, but it is unclear exactly how this process occurs.
Here, Murley et al. use the budding yeast and model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that at mitochondrial division sites, a multiprotein complex called ERMES promotes the formation of ER–mitochondrial contact points, while an evolutionarily conserved enzyme, Gem1, antagonizes these contacts to aid mitochondrial segregation. The contact points are found adjacent to nucleoids (which are complexes of mitochondrial DNA and proteins)—an observation suggesting that ER-associated mitochondrial division evolved to help distribute nucleoids between newly formed mitochondria.
The present study also reveals a novel role for the conserved protein Gem1 and could lead researchers to reinvestigate the functions of Miro1/2—the equivalent of Gem1 in higher eukaryotes. Miro1/2 is thought to connect mitochondria to motor proteins, which transports them through the cell along microtubules. Dysfunction of Miro1/2 reduces the mobility of mitochondria, and the work of Murley et al. suggests that this could be a consequence of enhanced contacts between mitochondria and the ER.

	abstract = {We used electron cryotomography to study the molecular arrangement of large respiratory chain complexes in mitochondria from bovine heart, potato, and three types of fungi. Long rows of ATP synthase dimers were observed in intact mitochondria and cristae membrane fragments of all species that were examined. The dimer rows were found exclusively on tightly curved cristae edges. The distance between dimers along the rows varied, but within the dimer the distance between F1 heads was constant. The angle between monomers in the dimer was 70° or above. Complex I appeared as L-shaped densities in tomograms of reconstituted proteoliposomes. Similar densities were observed in flat membrane regions of mitochondrial membranes from all species except Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified as complex I by quantum-dot labeling. The arrangement of respiratory chain proton pumps on flat cristae membranes and ATP synthase dimer rows along cristae edges was conserved in all species investigated. We propose that the supramolecular organization of respiratory chain complexes as proton sources and ATP synthase rows as proton sinks in the mitochondrial cristae ensures optimal conditions for efficient ATP synthesis.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term control of ATP synthesis during the course of Saccharomyces cerevisiae batch grown on lactate, a purely respiratory substrate. For this, we used a respirometric and on-line calorimetric approach to analyse the energetic balances and the control of energetic metabolism during growth. Enthalpic growth yields assessed by enthalpy balance (taking account of substrate consumption, by-product accumulation, biomass formation and heat dissipation) remained constant during the entire exponential growth. Moreover, at the same time, a parallel decrease in basal respiratory rate and enthalpy flux occurred. It is shown that the decrease in respiration corresponds to a decrease in the amount of mitochondria per cell but not to a change of steady state of oxidative phosphorylation. Taking into account the part of energy used for maintenance, it can be concluded that mitochondria by themselves are the major heat dissipative system in a fully aerobic metabolism, and that the decrease in the amount of mitochondria when growth rate decreases leads to an enthalpic growth yield constant.},

This fact sets obvious additional hurdles in the challenge of obtaining wines with reduced alcohols levels, a new trend in consumer demands. It would therefore be interesting to understand Saccharomyces cerevisiae physiology during the fermentation of must with these altered characteristics. The present study aims to determine the distribution of metabolic fluxes during the yeast exponential growth phase, when both carbon and nitrogen sources are in excess, using continuous cultures. Two different sugar concentrations were studied under two different winemaking temperature conditions. Although consumption and production rates for key metabolites were severely affected by the different experimental conditions studied, the general distribution of fluxes in central carbon metabolism was basically conserved in all cases. It was also observed that temperature and sugar concentration exerted a higher effect on the pentose phosphate pathway and glycerol formation than on glycolysis and ethanol production. Additionally, nitrogen uptake, both quantitatively and qualitatively, was strongly influenced by environmental conditions. This work provides the most complete stoichiometric model used for Metabolic Flux Analysis of S. cerevisiae in wine fermentations employed so far, including the synthesis and release of relevant aroma compounds and could be used in the design of optimal nitrogen supplementation of wine fermentations.},

Metabolic dysfunction plays an important role in many human diseases, including diabetes, cancer, inherited mitochondrial disorders, and metabolic syndrome. The monosaccharide glucose constitutes a key source of cellular energy. Following its import across the plasma membrane, glucose is converted into pyruvate by the glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate oxidation supplies substrates for the ATP-generating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. To gain cell-biochemical knowledge about the operation and regulation of the cellular energy metabolism in the healthy and diseased state, quantitative knowledge is required about (changes in) metabolite concentrations under (non) steady-state conditions. This information can, for instance, be used to construct more realistic in silico models of cell metabolism, which facilitates understanding the consequences of metabolic dysfunction as well as on- and off-target effects of mitochondrial drugs. Here we review the current state-of-the-art live-cell quantification of two key cellular metabolites, glucose and ATP, using protein-based sensors. The latter apply the principle of FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) and allow measurements in different cell compartments by fluorescence microscopy. We further summarize the properties and applications of the FRET-based sensors, their calibration, pitfalls, and future perspectives.},

Recent studies challenge this theory by demonstrating that in some cases, longevity is enhanced by inactivation of oxidative stress defenses or is correlated with increased, rather than decreased reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage. Here we show that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, caloric restriction or inactivation of catalases extends chronological lifespan by inducing elevated levels of the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, which activate superoxide dismutases that inhibit the accumulation of superoxide anions. Increased hydrogen peroxide in catalase-deficient cells extends chronological lifespan despite parallel increases in oxidative damage.

	abstract = {Mitochondria form a dynamic tubular reticulum within eukaryotic cells. Currently, quantitative understanding of its morphological characteristics is largely absent, despite major progress in deciphering the molecular fission and fusion machineries shaping its structure. Here we address the principles of formation and the large-scale organization of the cell-wide network of mitochondria. On the basis of experimentally determined structural features we establish the tip-to-tip and tip-to-side fission and fusion events as dominant reactions in the motility of this organelle. Subsequently, we introduce a graph-based model of the chondriome able to encompass its inherent variability in a single framework. Using both mean-field deterministic and explicit stochastic mathematical methods we establish a relationship between the chondriome structural network characteristics and underlying kinetic rate parameters. The computational analysis indicates that mitochondrial networks exhibit a percolation threshold. Intrinsic morphological instability of the mitochondrial reticulum resulting from its vicinity to the percolation transition is proposed as a novel mechanism that can be utilized by cells for optimizing their functional competence via dynamic remodeling of the chondriome. The detailed size distribution of the network components predicted by the dynamic graph representation introduces a relationship between chondriome characteristics and cell function. It forms a basis for understanding the architecture of mitochondria as a cell-wide but inhomogeneous organelle. Analysis of the reticulum adaptive configuration offers a direct clarification for its impact on numerous physiological processes strongly dependent on mitochondrial dynamics and organization, such as efficiency of cellular metabolism, tissue differentiation and aging., Mitochondria control energy production, initiation of cell death and several other critical cellular processes. Most often, they form a constantly reshaping tubular reticulum spread over the cytosol. Despite extensive knowledge of mitochondrial physiology, accurate description of their large-scale architecture is missing, partly due to substantial variability of reticulum geometries found in different cell types, and a capability for fast radical changes. We address this shortcoming with a mathematical model representing the organelle as a cell-wide dynamical network subjected to opposing actions of fission and internal fusion – processes known experimentally but not yet accurately specified. This opens a way for the quantitative characterization of the large-scale organization by showing how particular types of the internal dynamics can shape the reticulum into the whole multitude of configurations observed in biological studies. Further analysis reveals that for a specific value of tip-to-side fission/fusion rates the network should undergo a radical reorganization. Because of the high morphological sensitivity to minute changes in fusion or fission rates close to the critical point, cells can quickly adapt the mitochondrial operation and structure to their actual needs at a low expenditure of energy.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial fusion remains a largely unknown process despite its observation by live microscopy and the identification of few implicated proteins. Using green and red fluorescent proteins targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, we show that mitochondrial fusion in human cells is efficient and achieves complete mixing of matrix contents within 12 h. This process is maintained in the absence of a functional respiratory chain, despite disruption of microtubules or after significant reduction of cellular ATP levels. In contrast, mitochondrial fusion is completely inhibited by protonophores that dissipate the inner membrane potential. This inhibition, which results in rapid fragmentation of mitochondrial filaments, is reversible: small and punctate mitochondria fuse to reform elongated and interconnected ones upon withdrawal of protonophores. Expression of wild-type or dominant-negative dynamin-related protein 1 showed that fragmentation is due to dynamin-related protein 1-mediated mitochondrial division. On the other hand, expression of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), one of the human Fzo homologues, increased mitochondrial length and interconnectivity. This process, but not Mfn1 targeting, was dependent on the inner membrane potential, indicating that overexpressed Mfn1 stimulates fusion. These results show that human mitochondria represent a single cellular compartment whose exchanges and interconnectivity are dynamically regulated by the balance between continuous fusion and fission reactions.},

	abstract = {Mitophagy, the autophagic degradation of mitochondria, is an important housekeeping function in eukaryotic cells, and defects in mitophagy correlate with ageing phenomena and with several neurodegenerative disorders. A central mechanistic question regarding mitophagy is whether mitochondria are consumed en masse, or whether an active process segregates defective molecules from functional ones within the mitochondrial network, thus allowing a more efficient culling mechanism. Here we combine a proteomic study with a molecular genetics and cell biology approach to determine whether such a segregation process occurs in yeast mitochondria. We find that different mitochondrial matrix proteins undergo mitophagic degradation at distinctly different rates, supporting the active segregation hypothesis. These differential degradation rates depend on mitochondrial dynamics, suggesting a mechanism coupling weak physical segregation with mitochondrial dynamics to achieve a distillation-like effect. In agreement, the rates of mitophagic degradation strongly correlate with the degree of physical segregation of specific matrix proteins.},

With the use of genome-wide mapping of genetic interactions, we showed that the components of the tethering complex were functionally connected to phospholipid biosynthesis and calcium-signaling genes. In mutant cells, phospholipid biosynthesis was impaired. The tethering complex localized to discrete foci, suggesting that discrete sites of close apposition between ER and mitochondria facilitate interorganelle calcium and phospholipid exchange.},

	abstract = {Isolated mitochondria are capable of undergoing dramatic reversible ultrastructural transformations between a condensed and an orthodox conformation. These two conformations are the extremes in ultrastructural organization between which structually and functionally intact mitochondria transform during reversible respiratory cycles. It has been found that electron transport is required for the condensed-to-orthodox ultrastructural transformation which occurs in mitochondria under State IV conditions, i.e., under conditions in which exogenous substrate is present and ADP is deficient. Inhibition of State IV electron transport at the cyanide-, antimycin A-, or Amytal-sensitive sites in the respiratory chain results in inhibition of this transformation. Resumption of electron transport in initially inhibited mitochondrial systems, initiated by channeling electrons through pathways which bypass the inhibited sites, results in resumption of the ultrastructural transformation. The condensed-to-orthodox transformation is DNP insensitive and, therefore, does not require participation of the coupling enzymes of the energy-transfer pathway. It is concluded that this ultrastructural transformation is manifest by the conversion of the chemical energy of electron transport directly into mechanical work. The reversed ultrastructural transformation, i.e., orthodox-to-condensed, which occurs during ADP-activated State III electron transport, is inhibited by DNP and parallels suppression of acceptor control and oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanochemical ultrastructural transformation as a basis for energy transfer in mitochondria is considered with respect to the results presented.},

They are the main source of the cell's energy supply and are involved in such important processes as apoptosis, mitochondrial diseases, and aging. During recent years it also became apparent that mitochondria display a complex dynamical behavior of fission and fusion, the function of which is as yet unknown. In this paper we develop a concise theory that explains why fusion and fission have evolved, how these processes are related to the accumulation of mitochondrial mutants during aging, why the mitochondrial DNA has to be located close to the respiration complexes where most radicals are generated, and what selection pressures shaped the slightly different structure of animal and plant mitochondria. We believe that this “organelle control” theory will help in understanding key processes involved in the evolution of the mitochondrial genome and the aging process.},

The tail domain of Myo2p was coimmunoprecipitated with Ypt11p, suggesting that Ypt11p forms a complex with Myo2p at its tail domain in vivo. Mutational analysis of YPT11 suggests that Myo2p is a putative effector of Ypt11p. Deletion of YPT11 induced partial delay of mitochondrial transmission to the bud, and overexpression of YPT11 resulted in mitochondrial accumulation in the bud, indicating that Ypt11p acts positively on mitochondrial distribution toward the bud. We isolated two myo2 mutants, myo2-338 and myo2-573, which showed genetic interactions with YPT11. The myo2-573 mutation, identified by a synthetic lethal interaction with ypt11-null, induced a defect in mitochondrial distribution toward the bud, indicating that Myo2p plays a crucial role in polarized distribution of mitochondria. The myo2-338 mutation was identified as the mutation that abolished the effect of overexpressed YPT11, such as the Ypt11p-dependent accumulation of mitochondria in the bud, and the affinity of Myo2p for Ypt11p was reduced. These results indicate that complex formation of Ypt11p with Myo2p accelerates the function of Myo2p for mitochondrial distribution toward the bud.},

	abstract = {Because of its importance in the chemiosmotic theory, mitochondrial membrane potential has been the object of many investigations. Significantly, however, quantitative data on how energy transduction might be regulated or perturbed by the physiological state of the cell has only been gathered via indirect studies on isolated mitochondrial suspensions; quantitative studies on individual mitochondria in situ have not been possible because of their small size, their intrinsic motility, and the absence of appropriate analytical reagents. In this article, we combine techniques for rapid, high resolution, quantitative three-dimensional imaging microscopy and mathematical modeling to determine accurate distributions of a potentiometric fluorescent probe between the cytosol and individual mitochondria inside a living cell. Analysis of this distribution via the Nernst equation permits assignment of potentials to each of the imaged mitochondrial membranes. The mitochondrial membrane potentials are distributed over a narrow range centered at -150 mV within the neurites of differentiated neuroblastoma cells. We find that the membrane potential of a single mitochondrion is generally remarkably stable over times of 40–80 s, but significant fluctuations can occasionally be seen. The motility of individual mitochondria is not directly correlated to membrane potential, but mitochondria do become immobile after prolonged treatment with respiratory inhibitors or uncouplers. Thus, three spatial dimensions, a key physiological parameter, and their changes over time are all quantitated for objects at the resolution limit of light microscopy. The methods described may be readily extended to permit investigations of how mitochondrial function is integrated with other processes in the intact cell.},

We have therefore investigated the effects of rotenone, myxothiazol, antimycin A, cyanide (CN−) and oligomycin on isolated carotid body type I cells. All five compounds caused a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+, which was inhibited on removal of extracellular Ca2+. Under current clamp conditions rotenone and CN− caused a rapid membrane depolarization and elevation of [Ca2+]i. Voltage clamping cells to −70 mV substantially attenuated this rise in [Ca2+]i. Rotenone, cyanide, myxothiazol and oligomycin significantly inhibited resting background K+ currents. Thus rotenone, myxothiazol, cyanide and oligomycin mimic the effects of hypoxia in that they all inhibit background K+ current leading to membrane depolarization and voltage-gated calcium entry. Hypoxia, however, failed to have any additional effect upon membrane currents in the presence of CN− or rotenone or the mitochondrial uncoupler p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP). Thus not only do mitochondrial inhibitors mimic the effects of hypoxia, but they also abolish oxygen sensitivity. These observations suggest that there is a close link between oxygen sensing and mitochondrial function in type I cells. Mechanisms that could account for this link and the actions of mitochondrial inhibitors are discussed.},

Gene sequence data strongly support a monophyletic origin of the mitochondrion from a eubacterial ancestor shared with a subgroup of the alpha-Proteobacteria. However, recent studies of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), some of them little known, have provided insights that challenge the traditional serial endosymbiosis-based view of how the eukaryotic cell and its mitochondrion came to be. These data indicate that the mitochondrion arose in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes and raise the possibility that this organelle originated at essentially the same time as the nuclear component of the eukaryotic cell rather than in a separate, subsequent event.},

However, very little is known about the specific nature of the degradation process. We developed a new method to detect mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) by fusing the green fluorescent protein at the C terminus of two endogenous mitochondrial proteins and monitored vacuolar release of green fluorescent protein. Using this method, we screened several atg mutants and found that ATG11, a gene that is essential only for selective autophagy, is also essential for mitophagy. In addition, we found that mitophagy is blocked even under severe starvation conditions, if the carbon source makes mitochondria essential for metabolism. These findings suggest that the degradation of mitochondria is a tightly regulated process and that these organelles are largely protected from nonspecific autophagic degradation.},

	abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate substantial variability in protein concentration1. However, its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability. Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a different G1 cyclin.},

	abstract = {Glucose and related sugars repress the transcription of genes encoding enzymes required for the utilization of alternative carbon sources; some of these genes are also repressed by other sugars such as galactose, and the process is known as catabolite repression. The different sugars produce signals which modify the conformation of certain proteins that, in turn, directly or through a regulatory cascade affect the expression of the genes subject to catabolite repression. These genes are not all controlled by a single set of regulatory proteins, but there are different circuits of repression for different groups of genes. However, the protein kinase Snf1/Cat1 is shared by the various circuits and is therefore a central element in the regulatory process. Snf1 is not operative in the presence of glucose, and preliminary evidence suggests that Snf1 is in a dephosphorylated state under these conditions. However, the enzymes that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate Snf1 have not been identified, and it is not known how the presence of glucose may affect their activity. What has been established is that Snf1 remains active in mutants lacking either the proteins Grr1/Cat80 or Hxk2 or the Glc7 complex, which functions as a protein phosphatase. One of the main roles of Snf1 is to relieve repression by the Mig1 complex, but it is also required for the operation of transcription factors such as Adr1 and possibly other factors that are still unidentified. Although our knowledge of catabolite repression is still very incomplete, it is possible in certain cases to propose a partial model of the way in which the different elements involved in catabolite repression may be integrated.},

Using fluorescence-recovery after photobleaching, we observed that DsRed1 and calcein were highly mobile within the matrix of individual mitochondria, and that mitochondria within a cell were not lumenally continuous. Mitochondria were not electrically coupled, since only individual mitochondria were observed to depolarize following irradiation of TMRE-loaded cells. Functional heterogeneity of mitochondria in single cells was observed with respect to membrane potential, sequestration of hormonally evoked cytosolic calcium signals and timing of permeability transition pore opening in response to tert-butyl hydroperoxide.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether: (1) mitochondria in mouse coronary endothelial cells (MCECs) isolated from diabetic mice exhibit increased fragmentation; and (2) chronic treatment with a superoxide anion (O 2 − ) scavenger has a beneficial effect on mitochondrial fragmentation in MCECs. Methods MCECs were freshly isolated and lysed for protein measurement, or cultured to determine mitochondrial morphology and O 2 − production. For the ex vivo hyperglycaemia experiments, human coronary endothelial cells were used. Results Elongated mitochondrial tubules were observed in MCECs isolated from control mice, whereas mitochondria in MCECs from diabetic mice exhibited augmented fragmentation. The level of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein, which leads to mitochondrial fusion, was significantly decreased, while dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), which leads to mitochondrial fission, was significantly increased in MCECs from diabetic mice. Diabetic MCECs exhibited significantly higher O 2 − concentrations in cytosol and mitochondria than control MCECs. Administration of the O 2 − scavenger TEMPOL to diabetic mice for 4 weeks led to a significant decrease in mitochondrial fragmentation without altering the levels of OPA1 and DRP1 proteins in MCECs. High-glucose treatment for 24 h significantly induced mitochondrial fragmentation, which was restored by TEMPOL treatment. In addition, excess O 2 − production, either in cytosol or in mitochondria, significantly increased mitochondrial fragmentation. Conclusions/interpretation These data suggest that lowering the O 2 − concentration can restore the morphological change in mitochondria and may help improve mitochondrial function in diabetic MCECs.},

Mitochondria show a striking heterogeneity in their number, location, and shape in many different cell types. Although the dynamic nature of mitochondria has been known for decades, the molecules and mechanisms that mediate these processes are largely unknown. Recently, several laboratories have isolated and analyzed mutants in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in mitochondrial fusion and division, in the segregation of mitochondria to daughter cells, and in the establishment and maintenance of mitochondrial shape. These studies have identified several proteins that appear to mediate different aspects of mitochondrial morphogenesis. Although it is clear that many additional components have yet to be identified, some of the newly discovered proteins raise intriguing possibilities for how the processes of mitochondrial division, fusion, and segregation occur.

	abstract = {The optical properties of metallic nanostructures are of interest to scientists and engineers. They allow the manipulation of light on a microscopic level, which has applications in photonics, optoelectronics and energy conversion. In this dissertation, we investigate the surface plasmon resonances, near fields and scattering properties of these structures and their interaction with semiconductors.
The optical properties of metallic nanoparticles are analyzed by EM theory and finite element simulation. We perform experiments where the scattered fields of the nanoparticles are coupled to semiconductor photodiodes. From the results we study how the near fields and scattering properties can influence the optical absorption response spectrum in such devices. We find that the quasi-static behavior of the nanoparticles can explain the observed modulation in the absorption spectra. We also apply the same methods of simulation and experiment to Silicon-on-Insulator photodetectors. The coupling between the nanoparticles and waveguide modes in the silicon film leads to large increases in absorption, particularly in the infrared wavelengths, where silicon is a poor absorber. We find that we can engineer the absorption enhancement spectra by controlling the nanoparticle distribution.
Another application that we investigate is in UV multi-spectral imaging. We study dielectric overlayer transmission grating structures and exploit the surface plasmon and dielectric waveguide properties of our structures to engineer UV band reject filters. The exploitation of metallic nano-structures is necessary as traditional materials for resonating optical structures do not work well in the UV. Finally, we investigate metallic scattering backside reflectors for optimal light trapping in ultrathin film solar cells. Such solar cells suffer from poor quantum efficiency at certain wavelengths due to long photon absorption length. Therefore coupling of incident light into waveguide modes is an effective way to increase the quantum efficiency. By numerical analysis we study the performance of random vs periodic texturing of the backside reflector. The results are useful for designing optimal solar cells with very thin absorber layers.},

	abstract = {We present an integrated thermokinetic model describing control of cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics. The model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH2, which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (ΔμH), driving the F1F0-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, determined by Ca2+ uniporter and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activities, regulates activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and matrix concentrations of Ca2+, NADH, ADP, and TCA cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca2+. The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca2+ dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption (VO2), proton efflux, NADH, and ATP synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, are obtained when the Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial NADH dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.},

	abstract = {The mitochondrial membrane potential (psimito) is an important parameter not only of mitochondrial but also of cellular status. Prolonged mitochondrial depolarization is associated with various forms of neuronal death. Assessment of mitochondrial depolarization can take advantage of the specific properties of the lipophilic dyes that distribute in a potentiometrically determined ratio across membranes. Using conventional imaging, we showed that rhodamine 123 accumulated in the mitochondria, generating a highly heterogeneous pattern of spatial distribution of fluorescence across the cell body. Collapse of the psimito following exposure to a protonophore, carbonylcyanide p-chloromethoxyphenylhydrazone (CCCP), released rhodamine 123 from mitochondria into the cytosol. Under acutely changed conditions, this increased the overall intensity of the fluorescence signal and significantly decreased the degree of spatial heterogeneity of the signal. If mitochondrial depolarization was sustained chronically, the intensity of the signal decreased, but the increase in the spatial homogeneity of the fluorescent signal was maintained. Image analysis showed that the level of spatial heterogeneity of the signal can be assessed by calculating, for each individual neurone, the spread of pixel intensities values around the mean. This spread is defined by the coefficient of variation (CV), which is a measure of the standard deviation normalized to the average, and was inversely related to mitochondrial depolarization measured under different conditions. Thus, the degree of spatial heterogeneity of the rhodamine 123 signal measured from a neurone is a reliable indicator for the assessment of mitochondrial depolarization and can be used in experiments to monitor psimito over shorter or longer periods.},

	abstract = {Asymmetric segregation of oxidatively damaged proteins is discussed in the literature as a mechanism in cell division cycles which at the same time causes rejuvenation of the daughter cell and aging of the mother cell. This process must be viewed as cooperating with the cellular degradation processes like autophagy, proteasomal degradation and others. Together, these two mechanisms guarantee survival of the species and prevent clonal senescence of unicellular organisms, like yeast. It is widely believed that oxidative damage to proteins is primarily caused by oxygen radicals and their follow-up products produced in the mitochondria. As we have shown previously, old yeast mother cells in contrast to young cells contain reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. Here we show that aconitase of the mitochondrial matrix is readily inactivated by oxidative stress, but even in its inactive form is relatively long-lived and retains fluorescence in the Aco1p-eGFP form. The fluorescent protein is distributed between old mothers and their daughters approximately corresponding to the different sizes of mother and daughter cells. However, the remaining active enzyme is primarily inherited by the daughter cells. This indicates that asymmetric distribution of the still active enzyme takes place and a mechanism for discrimination between active and inactive enzyme must exist. As the aconitase remains mitochondrial during aging and cell division, our findings could indicate discrimination between active and no longer active mitochondria during the process.},

In budding yeast, mitochondrial shape is also maintained by proteins acting in the tubulation pathway. Novel proteins and pathways that control mitochondrial dynamics continue to be discovered, indicating that the mechanisms governing this organelle's behavior are more sophisticated than previously appreciated.

Using short hairpin RNAs for RNA interference, we manipulated the expression levels of the proteins hFis1, Drp1, and Opa1 that are involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion in mammalian cells, and we characterized their functions in mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis. Down-regulation of hFis1 powerfully inhibits cell death to an extent significantly greater than down-regulation of Drp1 and at a stage of apoptosis distinct from that induced by Drp1 inhibition. Cells depleted of Opa1 are extremely sensitive to exogenous apoptosis induction, and some die spontaneously by a process that requires hFis1 expression. Wild-type Opa1 may function normally as an antiapoptotic protein, keeping spontaneous apoptosis in check. However, if hFis1 is down-regulated, cells do not require Opa1 to prevent apoptosis, suggesting that Opa1 may be normally counteracting the proapoptotic action of hFis1. We also demonstrate in this study that mitochondrial fragmentation per se does not result in apoptosis. However, we provide further evidence that multiple components of the mitochondrial morphogenesis machinery can positively and negatively regulate apoptosis.},

Proponents of this hypothesis have focused their attention, not surprisingly, on mitochondria arguing that these organelles may serve as the biological clock for aging. Indeed, work on many models, including filamentous fungi, nematodes, and mammals have revealed that age-dependent reorganizations of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may play a central role in the aging of these organisms. Furthermore, genetic alterations of mitochondrial function may either shorten or extend life span. In this paper, we focus on the role of mitochondria in the replicative aging of yeast mother cells, whether this role of mitochondria is really a linked to altered ROS production and/or respiration, and highlight some important questions that remain to be answered.},

The experiments to measure uptake showed that a large amount of the dye was taken up by the cells under "deenergized" conditions. The uptake of the cyanine, however, was significantly reduced by the omission of the substrate, by deenergization of the mitochondria, or by the addition of K+, but not by Na+.

Mitochondria, the main suppliers of cellular energy, are dynamic organelles that fuse and divide frequently. Constraining these processes impairs mitochondrial is closely linked to certain neurodegenerative diseases. It is proposed that functional mitochondrial dynamics allows the exchange of compounds thereby providing a rescue mechanism.

Methodology/Principal Findings
The question discussed in this paper is whether fusion and fission of mitochondria in different cell lines result in re-localization of respiratory chain (RC) complexes and of the ATP synthase. This was addressed by fusing cells containing mitochondria with respiratory complexes labelled with different fluorescent proteins and resolving their time dependent re-localization in living cells. We found a complete reshuffling of RC complexes throughout the entire chondriome in single HeLa cells within 2–3 h by organelle fusion and fission. Polykaryons of fused cells completely re-mixed their RC complexes in 10–24 h in a progressive way. In contrast to the recently described homogeneous mixing of matrix-targeted proteins or outer membrane proteins, the distribution of RC complexes and ATP synthase in fused hybrid mitochondria, however, was not homogeneous but patterned. Thus, complete equilibration of respiratory chain complexes as integral inner mitochondrial membrane complexes is a slow process compared with matrix proteins probably limited by complete fusion. In co-expressing cells, complex II is more homogenously distributed than complex I and V, resp. Indeed, this result argues for higher mobility and less integration in supercomplexes.

Conclusion/Significance
Our results clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics favours the re-mixing of all RC complexes within the chondriome. This permanent mixing avoids a static situation with a fixed composition of RC complexes per mitochondrion.},

Because ROS can damage biomolecules, cells contain elaborate antioxidant defense systems to prevent oxidative stress. In addition to their damaging effect, ROS can also operate as intracellular signaling molecules. Given the fact that mitochondrial ROS appear to be only generated at specific sites and that particular ROS species display a unique chemistry and have specific molecular targets, mitochondria-derived ROS might constitute local regulatory signals. The latter would allow individual mitochondria to auto-regulate their metabolism, shape and motility, enabling them to respond autonomously to the metabolic requirements of the cell. In this review we first summarize how mitochondrial ROS can be generated and removed in the living cell. Then we discuss experimental strategies for (local) detection of ROS by combining chemical or proteinaceous reporter molecules with quantitative live cell microscopy. Finally, approaches involving targeted pro- and antioxidants are presented, which allow the local manipulation of ROS levels.},

	abstract = {The energy metabolism of animals is shaped by the ecological niche and requires adaptation and acclimatisation to physiological and environmental challenge. These adjustments are complex at different systemic levels and involve regulation of ATP homeostasis at the cellular level. Mitochondria are central to the conversion of nutrient to cellular energy (ATP). Mitochondrial ATP production is not fully efficient, flexible and allows a certain degree of plasticity for physiological adjustments. As a result of an inefficient energy transduction, by-products such as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and heat are formed. Thus, a quantifiable knowledge on mitochondrial efficiency is required to understand the significance of mitochondrial adjustments for the biology and fitness of the animal. This chapter serves as a general introduction on the principles of mitochondrial energy transduction and efficiency, how to measure mitochondrial energy transduction in isolated mitochondria, reviews past efforts to elucidate adjustments of mitochondrial mechanisms and suggests future perspectives of mitochondrial bioenergetics in integrative and comparative physiology. In particular novel technologies, such as non-invasive measurement of oxygen consumption and membrane potential with fluorescent probes, allow the assessment of energy transduction in the living cell , therefore becoming the next stage to study mitochondrial energy metabolism.},

However, light microscopy reveals no significant neurodegeneration in these mice. It remains unclear how mutant huntingtin induces neurodegeneration. Using caspase staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling, and electron microscopy, we observed that N171-82Q mice, which express the first 171 aa of mutant huntingtin, displayed more degenerated neurons than did other HD mouse models. The neurodegeneration was also evidenced by increased immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein and ultrastructural features of apoptosis. R6/2 mice, which express exon 1 of mutant huntingtin, showed dark, nonapoptotic neurons and degenerated mitochondria associated with mutant huntingtin. In HD repeat knock-in mice (HdhCAG150), which express full-length mutant huntingtin, degenerated cytoplasmic organelles were found in both axons and neuronal cell bodies in association with mutant huntingtin that was not labeled by an antibody to huntingtin amino acids 342–456. Transfection of cultured cells with mutant huntingtin revealed that an N-terminal huntingtin fragment (amino acids 1–208 plus a 120 glutamine repeat) caused a greater increase in caspase activity than did exon 1 huntingtin and longer huntingtin fragments. These results suggest that context-dependent neurodegeneration in HD may be mediated by different N-terminal huntingtin fragments. In addition, this study has identified neurodegenerative markers for the evaluation of therapeutic treatments in HD mouse models.},

Oxidative stress is a deleterious force that must be combated relentlessly by aerobic organisms and is known to underlie many human diseases including atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Information available about the oxidative stress response has come primarily from studies using reactive oxygen species (ROS) with ill-defined locations within the cell. Thus, existing models do not account for possible differences between stress originating within particular regions of the cell. Here, oxidative stress is studied at the subcellular level using ROS-generating compounds localizing within two different organelles: the nucleus and the mitochondrion. Differences in cytotoxicity, gene expression, and survival pathway activation are detected as a function of the subcellular origin of oxidative stress, indicating that independent mechanisms are used to cope with oxidative stress arising in different cellular compartments. These comparative studies, enabled by the development of organelle-specific oxidants, examine the cellular responses to site-specific oxidative stress with heightened precision.},

	abstract = {Recently, we and others have shown that genetic and environmental changes that increase the load of yeast cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to a shortening of the life span of yeast mother cells. Deletions of yeast genes coding for the superoxide dismutases or the catalases, as well as changes in atmospheric oxygen concentration, considerably shortened the life span. The presence of the physiological antioxidant glutathione, on the other hand, increased the life span of yeast cells. Taken together, these results pointed to a role for oxygen in the yeast ageing process. Here, we show by staining with dihydrorhodamine that old yeast mother cells isolated by elutriation, but not young cells, contain ROS that are localized in the mitochondria. A relatively large proportion of the old mother cells shows phenotypic markers of yeast apoptosis, i.e. TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling) and annexin V staining. Although it has been shown previously that apoptosis in yeast can be induced by a cdc48 allele, by expressing pro-apoptotic human cDNAs or by stressing the cells with hydrogen peroxide, we are now showing a physiological role for apoptosis in unstressed but aged wild-type yeast mother cells.},

	abstract = {Respiration in all cells depends upon synthesis of ATP by the ATP synthase complex, a rotary motor enzyme. The structure of the catalytic moiety of ATP synthase, the so-called F1 headpiece, is well established. F1 is connected to the membrane-bound and ion translocating F0 subcomplex by a central stalk. A peripheral stalk, or stator, prevents futile rotation of the headpiece during catalysis. Although the enzyme functions as a monomer, several lines of evidence have recently suggested that monomeric ATP synthase complexes might interact to form a dimeric supercomplex in mitochondria. However, due to its fragility, the structure of ATP synthase dimers has so far not been precisely defined for any organism. Here we report the purification of a stable dimeric ATP synthase supercomplex, using mitochondria of the alga Polytomella. Structural analysis by electron microscopy and single particle analysis revealed that dimer formation is based on specific interaction of the F0 parts, not the F1 headpieces which are not at all in close proximity. Remarkably, the angle between the two F0 part is about 70°, which induces a strong local bending of the membrane. Hence, the function of ATP synthase dimerisation is to control the unique architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane.},

Fission and fusion are important for growth, for mitochondrial redistribution, and for maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial network. In addition, mitochondrial fission and fusion play prominent roles in disease-related processes such as apoptosis and mitophagy. Three members of the Dynamin family are key components of the fission and fusion machineries.

	abstract = {Summary
Mitochondria amplify activation of caspases during apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c and other cofactors. This is accompanied by fragmentation of the organelle and remodeling of the cristae. Here we provide evidence that Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1), a profusion dynamin-related protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane mutated in dominant optic atrophy, protects from apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release independently from mitochondrial fusion. OPA1 does not interfere with activation of the mitochondrial “gatekeepers” BAX and BAK, but it controls the shape of mitochondrial cristae, keeping their junctions tight during apoptosis. Tightness of cristae junctions correlates with oligomerization of two forms of OPA1, a soluble, intermembrane space and an integral inner membrane one. The proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BID, which widens cristae junctions, also disrupts OPA1 oligomers. Thus, OPA1 has genetically and molecularly distinct functions in mitochondrial fusion and in cristae remodeling during apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Focused pulsed laser irradiation allows for the deposition of energy with high spatial and temporal resolution. These attributes provide an optimal tool for non-contact manipulation in cellular biology such as laser microsurgery, cell membrane permeabilization, as well as targeted cell death.
In this thesis we investigate the direct physical effects produced by laser- generated microcavitation bubbles in adherent cell cultures. We examine how variation in pulse durations (180 ps - 6ns) and pulse energy (0.5 - 40 μ;J) affect microcavitation bubble ( μ ;CB) generated cell lysis, necrosis, and molecular delivery. To compare the effects of pulse duration we employ classical fluid dynamics modeling to quantify the perturbation caused on cell populations from μ ;CB generated microTsunamis (a transient microscale burst of hydrodynamic shear stress). Through time-resolved imaging we capture the μ ;CB dynamics at various energies and pulse durations. Moreover, the mathematical modeling provides information regarding the cellular exposure to time varying shear stress and impulse as a function of radial location from the μ ;CB center. We demonstrate that the resultant cellular effect can be predicted based on the total impulse across a two order of magnitude span of pulse duration and pulse energy.
We also examine the region of cells beyond the zone of molecular delivery to investigate possible cellular reactions to μ ;Tsunami exposure. Our studies have shown that cellular mechanotransduction occurs within cell populations spanning an area of up to 1 mm2 surrounding the μ ;CB. Visualization of mechanotransduction is achieved through the visualization of intracellular calcium signaling via fluorescence microscopy that occurs due to the ability of the μ Tsunami generated shear stresses to stimulate G-protein coupled receptors at the apical cell surface. Moreover, we have shown that the observed signaling can be attenuated in a dose-dependent manner using 2-APB which is a known inhibitor to IP 3 induced Ca2+ release. This capability opens the development of a high-throughput screening platform for molecules that modulate cellular mechanotransduction. We have applied this approach to screen the effects of a small set of small molecules, in a 96-well plate in less than an hour. These detailed studies offer a basis for the design, development, and implementation of a novel high-throughput mechanotransduction assay to rapidly screen the effect of small molecules on cellular mechanotransduction at high throughput.},

	abstract = {Although natural and synthetic ionophores are widely exploited in cell studies, for example, to influence cytoplasmic free calcium concentrations and to depolarize in situ mitochondria, their inherent lack of membrane selectivity means that they affect the ion permeability of both plasma and mitochondrial membranes. A similar ambiguity affects the interpretation of signals from fluorescent membrane-permeant cations (usually termed “mitochondrial membrane potential indicators”), because the accumulation of these probes is influenced by both plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials. To resolve some of these problems a technique is developed to allow simultaneous monitoring of plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials at single-cell resolution using a cationic and anionic fluorescent probe. A computer program is described that transforms the fluorescence changes into dynamic estimates of changes in plasma and mitochondrial potentials. Exploiting this technique, primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons display a concentration-dependent response to ionomycin: low concentrations mimic nigericin by hyperpolarizing the mitochondria while slowly depolarizing the plasma membrane and maintaining a stable elevated cytoplasmic calcium. Higher ionomycin concentrations induce a stochastic failure of calcium homeostasis that precedes both mitochondrial depolarization and an enhanced rate of plasma membrane depolarization. In addition, the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone only selectively depolarizes mitochondria at submicromolar concentrations. ATP synthase reversal following respiratory chain inhibition depolarizes the mitochondria by 26 mV.},

We measured the oxygen consumption required to drive the proton leak at the protonmotive force reached under each condition and subtracted it from the respiration rate during phosphorylation to determine the oxygen consumption driving phosphorylation. By dividing the rate of phosphorylation by the rate of respiration driving phosphorylation we calculated the mechanistic P/O ratio (number of molecules of ADP phosphorylated per oxygen atom reduced). This ratio was the same at high, intermediate and low values of protonmotive force, indicating that the relative stoichiometries of the mitochondrial protonmotive-force-producing and protonmotive-force-consuming pumps (i.e. H+/O:H+/ATP) are independent of the protonmotive force. This greatly weakens the case for a decrease in stoichiometry, or 'slip', in the mitochondrial proton pumps at high protonmotive force.},

The establishment and maintenance of different mitochondrial morphologies depends, in part, on the equilibrium between opposing fission and fusion events.

One of these is a dynamin-related GTPase that acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane to regulate fission. Recently, genetic approaches in budding yeast have identified additional components of the fission machinery. These and other new findings suggest a common mechanism for membrane fission events that has been conserved and adapted during eukaryotic evolution.},

We identify some inaccuracies in the BPLS original approximations for two flux rates, namely the adenine nucleotide translocator rate \$J\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ANT\}\$ and the calcium uniporter rate \$J\_\{{\textbackslash}rm uni\}\$. We introduce new approximations for such flux rates and then analyze some of the dynamical properties of the model. We infer, from exhaustive numerical explorations, that the enhanced BPLS equations have a unique attractor fixed point for physiologically acceptable ranges of mitochondrial variables and respiration inputs, as one would indeed expect from homeostasis. We determine, in the stationary regime, the dependence of the mitochondrial variables on the respiration inputs, namely the cytosolic concentration of calcium \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Ca\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\$ and the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate FBP. The same dynamical effects of calcium and FBP saturations reported for the original BPLS model are observed here. We find out, however, a novel non-stationary effect which could be, in principle, physiologically interesting: some response times of the model tend to increase considerably for high concentrations of calcium and/or FBP. In particular, the larger the concentrations of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Ca\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\$ and/or FBP, the larger the necessary time to attain homeostasis.},

The outer membrane protein Fis1p plays a crucial role in mitochondrial fission. Here we report on the temporal and spatial dynamics of this organelle in wild-type cells and in fis1Δ mutants. Mitochondria of fis1Δ mutants adapt their mitochondrial network to a change in carbon source. We find that the frequencies of apparent matrix separation and fusion events decrease in both wild-type cells and in mutants lacking Fis1p upon glucose repression. Matrix separation could be caused by matrix constriction and does not necessarily require fission of the inner or outer membrane. Double-labelling experiments demonstrated that some of these matrix separations in fis1 mutants are due to genuine tubule fissions, whereas others do not involve fission of the outer membrane. The rates of matrix separation in fis1Δ mutants almost approach those of the wildtype, demonstrating that, although apparently involved in outer membrane fission, Fis1p is not crucial for the separation of the mitochondrial matrix. In mutants lacking the GTPase Dnm1p no complete tubule fissions were recorded, although dnm1Δ mutants display matrix separations as well. The data suggest that different molecular machineries are responsible for the separation of the matrix and the fission of the outer membrane in budding yeast.},

The yeast mitochondria thus prepared oxidized members of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, d- and l-lactate, and tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine reduced by ascorbate. Respiratory control in response to the addition of adenosine diphosphate was observed with all of these substrates. The highest respiratory control ratio (5 to 6) was obtained with α-ketoglutarate as substrate. The yeast mitochondria actively oxidized externally added NADH, and this oxidation likewise showed respiratory control. The ADP to oxygen or phosphorus to oxygen ratios observed in this system were about 0.9 with tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine and lactate; 1.7 with succinate, NADH, citrate, and pyruvate plus catalytic amount of malate; and 2.5 with α-ketoglutarate. These respirations were completely insensitive to Amytal and rotenone. It is suggested that phosphorylation Site I is absent from these yeast mitochondria. Effects of uncouplers and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation on yeast mitochondria were very similar to those observed with mammalian mitochondria. The P:O ratios in the respiration with NADH as a substrate showed constant values when measured between pH 5.4 and 7.5, and at a range of tonicity between 0.3 and 1.0 m sorbitol. The yeast mitochondria could be stored for a long period of time without appreciable loss of phosphorylation activity. The components of electron transport of isolated yeast mitochondria were studied by means of difference spectrophotometry.

	abstract = {Fluorescence loss in photobleaching experiments and analysis of mitochondrial function using superoxide and redox potential biosensors revealed that mitochondria within individual yeast cells are physically and functionally distinct. Mitochondria that are retained in mother cells during yeast cell division have a significantly more oxidizing redox potential and higher superoxide levels compared to mitochondria in buds. Retention of mitochondria with more oxidizing redox potential in mother cells occurs to the same extent in young and older cells and can account for the age-associated decline in total cellular mitochondrial redox potential in yeast as they age from 0 to 5 generations. Deletion of Mmr1p, a member of the DSL1 family of tethering proteins that localizes to mitochondria at the bud tip and is required for normal mitochondrial inheritance, produces defects in mitochondrial quality control and heterogeneity in replicative lifespan (RLS). Long-lived mmr1Δ cells exhibit prolonged RLS, reduced mean generation times, more reducing mitochondrial redox potential and lower mitochondrial superoxide levels compared to wild-type cells. Short-lived mmr1Δ cells exhibit the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, short-lived cells give rise exclusively to short-lived cells, while the majority of daughters of long-lived cells are long lived. These findings support the model that the mitochondrial inheritance machinery promotes retention of lower-functioning mitochondria in mother cells and that this process contributes to both mother–daughter age asymmetry and age-associated declines in cellular fitness.},

	abstract = {An hypothesis considering mitochondria as intracellular power- transmitting protonic cables was tested in human fibroblasts where mitochondria are thin and long and in rat cardiomyocytes where they show cluster organization. Mitochondria in the cell were specifically stained with fluorescent-penetrating cation ethylrhodamine, which electrophoretically accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix. A 40- micron-long mitochondrial filament of fibroblast was illuminated by a very narrow (less than or equal to 0.5 micron) laser beam to induce local damage of the mitochondrial membranes. Such a treatment was found to induce quenching of the ethylrhodamine fluorescence in the entire filament. According to the electron microscope examination, the laser- treated filament retained its continuity after the laser illumination. Other mitochondrial filaments (some of which were localized at a distance less than 10 micron from the laser-treated one) remained fluorescent. In a cell where mitochondrial filaments seemed to be united in a network, laser illumination of one filament resulted in fluorescence quenching in the whole network, whereas fluorescence of small mitochondria not connected with the network was unaffected. The illumination of cardiomyocyte was found to result in the fluorescence quenching not only in a laser-illuminated mitochondrion but also in a large cluster of organelles composed of many mitochondria. Electron microscopy showed that all the mitochondria in the cluster change from the orthodox to the condensed state. It was also found that mitochondria in the cluster are connected to one another with specific junctions. If a mitochondrion did not form junctions with a quenched cluster, its fluorescence was not decreased even when this mitochondrion was localized close to an illuminated one. The size of the mitochondrial cluster may be as long as 50 micron. The cluster is formed by branched chains of contacting mitochondria, which may be defined as Streptio mitochondriale. In the cardiomyocyte there are several mitochondrial clusters or, alternatively, the quenched cluster is a result of decomposition of a supercluster uniting all the mitochondria of the cell. Cluster organization of mitochondria could also be revealed when a single mitochondrion was punctured in situ with a microcapillary. The obtained data are in agreement with the idea that mitochondrial junctions are H+ permeable so that, within the cluster, delta psi may be transmitted from one mitochondrion to another. The above results are consistent with the assumption that mitochondrial filaments or networks represent a united electrical system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The technique used was a variation of the steady-state method of Al-Shawi and Brand [(1981) Biochem. J. 200, 539–546]. We show that q+/O was about 2.7 at high values of ΔΨ (170 mV). As ΔΨ was lowered from 170 mV to 85 mV with the respiratory inhibitor malonate the q+/O stoichiometry increased to 6.0. A number of artefacts which could have led to an underestimation of the q+/O stoichiometry were eliminated. These included effects of any rapid change in mitochondrial volume, internal pH, activity of the endogenous K+/H+ exchanger or in H+ conductance due to changes in ΔΨ after the addition of inhibitor. The experiments presented here are the first direct demonstration that the stoichiometry of proton pumping by the mitochondrial respiratory chain changes as ΔΨ is varied.},

Cells deleted for SOP1 exhibited sensitivity to sodium stress, but showed no sensitivity to general osmotic stress. Following exposure of sop1Δ cells to NaCl stress, the intracellular Na+ level and the Na+/K+ ratio rose to values significantly higher than in wild type cells. Deletion of SOP2, encoding a protein sharing 54\% amino acid identity with Sop1p, produced only slight Na+ sensitivity. Cells carrying asop1Δsop2Δ double deletion became, however, hypersensitive to Na+ and exhibited increased sensitivity also to Li+ and K+, suggesting involvement of both SOP1 and SOP2 in cation homeostasis. The predicted amino acid sequences of Sop1p and Sop2p show significant homologies with the cytoskeletal-associated protein encoded by theDrosophila lethal(2)giant larvae tumor suppressor gene. Immunolocalization of Sop1p revealed a cytoplasmic distribution and cell fractionation studies showed that a significant fraction of Sop1p was recovered in a sedimentable fraction of the cytosolic material. Expression of a Drosophila l(2)gl cDNA in thesop1Δsop2Δ strain partially restored the Na+ tolerance of the cells, indicating a functional relationship between the Sop proteins and the tumor suppressor protein, and a novel function in cell homeostasis for this family of proteins extending from yeast to human.},

Mathematically modeling biological systems challenges our current understanding of the physical and biochemical events contributing to the observed dynamics. It requires careful consideration of hypothesized mechanisms, model development assumptions and details regarding the experimental conditions. We have adopted a modeling approach to translate these factors that explicitly considers the thermodynamic constraints, biochemical states and reaction mechanisms during model development. Such models have numerous constant parameters that must be determined. Integrating thermodynamics and detailed mechanistic representation of the principal phenomena help constrain these parameter values; therefore, only a handful of the total number of model parameters (∼10\%) must be adjusted during parameter estimation through model simulations. Additionally, all models must undergo some form of corroboration prior to application. In practice, this corroboration should challenge all possible dynamics of the model, but it is recognized that in this data rich world, we are surprisingly data poor. Eventually such developed and corroborated models are capable of supporting current hypotheses, guiding experimental designs and contributing to the overall knowledge base of biological processes.},

As the cellular power plant, mitochondria play a significant role in homeostasis. To maintain the proper quality and quantity of mitochondria requires both mitochondrial degradation and division. A selective type of autophagy, mitophagy, drives the degradation of excess or damaged mitochondria, whereas division is controlled by a specific fission complex; however, the relationship between these two processes, especially the role of mitochondrial fission during mitophagy, remains unclear. In this study, we report that mitochondrial fission is important for the progression of mitophagy. When mitophagy is induced, the fission complex is recruited to the degrading mitochondria through an interaction between Atg11 and Dnm1; interfering with this interaction severely blocks mitophagy. These data establish a paradigm for selective organelle degradation.},

A similar reduction in the amount of associated ribosomes was obtained when the initiation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis was inhibited using a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant. A change in the amount of mitochondria-bound cytoplasmic ribosomes was correlated directly with a change in the isopyknic density of the isolated mitochondria; moreover, the amount of cytoplasmic ribosomes associated with mitochondria could be predicted from the mitochondrial density.
Mitochondria prepared from log phase cells contain 7.6 A260 units of cytoplasmic rRNA per mg of protein and will bind in vitro no more than 0.4 A260 unit of cytoplasmic ribosomes per mg of mitochondrial protein. From these results we calculate that only about 5 \% of the ribosome binding sites are vacant in these mitochondrial preparations. On the other hand, mitochondria obtained from starved cells have only 4.7 A260 units of cytoplasmic rRNA per mg of protein and have a considerably greater capacity to bind ribosomes than mitochondria isolated from log phase cells.
The binding of free cytoplasmic polysomes or cytoplasmic polysomes extracted from mitochondria to a preparation of EDTA-washed mitochondria was completely inhibited by either 10-4 m aurintricarboxylic acid or 350 mm KCl. However, the addition of 10-3 m aurintricarboxylic acid or 350 mm KCl to the medium used for the isolation of mitochondria had little effect on the amount of cytoplasmic rRNA recovered with the mitochondria. These data support the conclusion that cytoplasmic ribosomes are bound to yeast mitochondria in vivo.},

This Δgut2 mutant strain demonstrated a threefold increase in lipid accumulation compared to the wild-type strain. However, mobilization of lipid reserves occurred after the exit from the exponential phase due to β-oxidation. Y. lipolytica contains six acyl-coenzyme A oxidases (Aox), encoded by the POX1 to POX6 genes, that catalyze the limiting step of peroxisomal β-oxidation. Additional deletion of the POX1 to POX6 genes in the Δgut2 strain led to a fourfold increase in lipid content. The lipid composition of all of the strains tested demonstrated high proportions of FFA. The size and number of the lipid bodies in these strains were shown to be dependent on the lipid composition and accumulation ratio.},

	abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells contain d and l-lactate: cytochrome c oxidoreductases. The physiological role of these enzymes is investigated by inhibiting the respiratory chain with antimycin A and observing how the vital functions (respiration, protein biosynthesis, growth) are altered. When d or l-lactate are provided as the source of energy, stoichiometric amounts of the antibiotic decrease the growth rate about five-fold, the oxygen uptake two-fold and the energetic efficiency eleven-fold. In the presence of antimycin A, it was often proposed that only a very short chain consisting of one of the lactate dehydrogenases, cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase could be involved in the oxidation of lactate. Consistent with this scheme are the measurements of lactate and oxygen uptake and the observation that keto acids are released into the external medium, which also allow one to rationalize the growth yield and the amino acid incorporation results.},

	doi = {10.1086/190685},
	abstract = {A detailed model is constructed for the disk and spheroid components of 
the Galaxy from which the distribution of visible stars and mass in the
Galaxy is calculated. The application of star counts to the
determination of galactic structure parameters is demonstrated. The
possibility of detecting a halo component with the aid of star counts is
also investigated quantitatively.

The stellar luminosity functions and scale heights are determined from
observations in the solar neighborhood. The global distribution of
matter is assumed, based on studies of other galaxies, to be an
exponential disk plus a de Vaucouleurs spheroid. The spheroid luminosity
function is found to have the same shape as the disk luminosity function
over the range of absolute magnitudes (+4 to + 12) that contributes
significantly to the star counts for mV ≤ 30. The density
of spheroid stars in the solar neighborhood is 1/800 of the value for
the disk. The star counts calculated using the density variation of a de
Vaucouleurs spheroid are consistent with the available data; the counts
predicted with the aid of a Hubble law are inconsistent with
observations at more than the two-sigma level of significance.

The variations of the calculated star densities with apparent magnitude,
latitude, and longitude agree well with the available star count data
for the observationally well studied range of 4 ≲ mV
≲ 22. The calculated (B - V) color distributions are also in good
agreement with existing data. The color data also indicate that QSOs
comprise only a few percent of the total number of stellar objects to
mV = 22 (mB = 22.5). The spheroid component is
found to be approximately spherical. The scale lengths of the Galaxy
model and computed total luminosity and M/L ratios for the disk and
spheroid are in agreement with observations of other Sbc galaxies.
Illustrative Fig. and a table of interesting characteristics (such as
the mass and luminosity contained within various radii and the escape
velocity) are provided.

Further ground-based observations at attainable faint magnitudes
(mV ≤ 23 mag) would be important. Star counts and (B - V)
colors in several widely separated selected fields would permit a more
accurate determination of the disk scale length and the spheroid star
density and ellipticity. The most effective regions in which to make
these observations are specified.

The Galaxy model of the disk and spheroid is used to predict the star
densities (in B and V) that may be observable with the aid of the Space
Telescope down to very faint magnitudes. The stellar density to
mV = 28 from the disk and spheroid is predicted to be
104 stars per square degree at the galactic pole. The
predicted star counts are insensitive to many of the model parameters,
although drastic changes in the shape of the luminosity function outside
the presently determined magnitude range could produce measurable
departures from the predicted star counts at faint magnitudes.

The rotation curve computed solely from the disk and spheroid components
decreases beyond about 10 kpc from the center of the Galaxy. A halo with
even a relatively small mass density in the Solar neighborhood
(ρHalo (Sun) = 0.01 Msun pc-3) can
give rise to a flat rotation curve. The stellar content of such a halo
would be revealed by observations with Space Telescope cameras if the
halo consists of main sequence stars with MV ≲ 19.0 mag
(existing observations imply MVMS ≳ 14.0 mag)
or faint white dwarfs with MVWD ≲ 17.5 mag
(existing observations imply MVWD ≳ 13.0
mag). Existing data imply (M/L)Halo ≳650 (Solar Visual
units).

The results for V magnitudes are described in the main text; the
corresponding results for B magnitudes are summarized in Appendix A. A
table of predicted differential and integrated star counts for both V
and B magnitudes is given in Appendix B. Simple formulae that reproduce
to an accuracy of 15\% the predicted model star densities as a function
of magnitude, latitude, and longitude are also provided in Appendix B.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION The study of the structure and organization of mitochondria in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  offers a unique opportunity to relate the considerable metabolic, genetic, and biochemical data on this organism to visible morphological entities. The ability of yeast to thrive under a variety of growth conditions permits their mitochondria to exist in a wide range of functional states and to maintain genetic deficiencies that would otherwise be lethal to an organism. In many cases, these functional states and mutations have their morphological counterpart in defined fine structural modifications of the mitochondrial population. In addition, the complex interaction of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in the formation of mitochondria can be dissociated in yeast by making use of  ρ  −  strains, which lack a functional mitochondrial genome and thus allow the contribution of the nuclear genome to be visualized directly. TECHNIQUES OF PREPARATION Although there are favorable aspects of yeast as an organism for the study of mitochondrial structure, an inherent and major difficulty lies in its rigid and impermeable cell wall. This wall, which enables yeast to survive drastic growth conditions, is a definite impediment to the standard preparation procedures for electron microscopy. The penetration of fixatives, notably osmium tetroxide, and the infiltration of embedding media are hindered, if not completely blocked, by the wall. To overcome this handicap, one may resort to the use of chemical fixatives that penetrate more readily, such as potassium permanganate. Alternatively, one may weaken or completely remove the cell wall by using digestive enzymes to allow...},

	abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reduction of NAD+ to NADH occurs in dissimilatory as well as in assimilatory reactions. This review discusses mechanisms for reoxidation of NADH in this yeast, with special emphasis on the metabolic compartmentation that occurs as a consequence of the impermeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane for NADH and NAD+. At least five mechanisms of NADH reoxidation exist in S. cerevisiae. These are: (1) alcoholic fermentation; (2) glycerol production; (3) respiration of cytosolic NADH via external mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases; (4) respiration of cytosolic NADH via the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle; and (5) oxidation of intramitochondrial NADH via a mitochondrial ‘internal’ NADH dehydrogenase. Furthermore, in vivo evidence indicates that NADH redox equivalents can be shuttled across the mitochondrial inner membrane by an ethanol–acetaldehyde shuttle. Several other redox-shuttle mechanisms might occur in S. cerevisiae, including a malate–oxaloacetate shuttle, a malate–aspartate shuttle and a malate–pyruvate shuttle. Although key enzymes and transporters for these shuttles are present, there is as yet no consistent evidence for their in vivo activity. Activity of several other shuttles, including the malate–citrate and fatty acid shuttles, can be ruled out based on the absence of key enzymes or transporters. Quantitative physiological analysis of defined mutants has been important in identifying several parallel pathways for reoxidation of cytosolic and intramitochondrial NADH. The major challenge that lies ahead is to elucidate the physiological function of parallel pathways for NADH oxidation in wild-type cells, both under steady-state and transient-state conditions. This requires the development of techniques for accurate measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations in separate metabolic compartments.},

	abstract = {Since the early days of mitochondrial medicine, it has been clear that optic atrophy is a very common and sometimes the singular pathological feature in mitochondrial disorders. The first point mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) associated with the maternally inherited blinding disorder, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), was recognized in 1988. In 2000, the other blinding disorder, dominant optic atrophy (DOA) Kjer type, was found associated with mutations in the nuclear gene OPA1 that encodes a mitochondrial protein. Besides these two non-syndromic optic neuropathies, optic atrophy is a prominent feature in many other neurodegenerative diseases that are now recognized as due to primary mitochondrial dysfunction. We will consider mtDNA based syndromes such as LHON/dystonia/Mitochondrial Encephalomyopahty Lactic Acidosis Stroke-like (MELAS)/Leigh overlapping syndrome, or nuclear based diseases such as Friedreich ataxia (mutations in FXN gene), deafness-dystonia-optic atrophy (Mohr-Tranebjerg) syndrome (mutations in TIMM8A), complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (mutations in SPG7), DOA "plus" syndromes (mutations in OPA1), Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A) with optic atrophy or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type VI (HMSN VI) (mutations in MFN2), and Costeff syndrome and DOA with cataract (mutations in OPA3). Thus, genetic errors in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes often lead to retinal ganglion cell death, a specific target for mitochondrial mediated neurodegeneration. Many mechanisms have been studied and proposed as the bases for the pathogenesis of mitochondrial optic neuropathies including bioenergetic failure, oxidative stress, glutamate toxicity, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and axonal transport, and susceptibility to apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Cytokinesis in unicellular organisms sometimes entails a division of labor between cells leading to lineage-specific aging. To investigate the potential benefits of asymmetrical cytokinesis, we created a mathematical model to simulate the robustness and fitness of dividing systems displaying different degrees of damage segregation and size asymmetries. The model suggests that systems dividing asymmetrically (size-wise) or displaying damage segregation can withstand higher degrees of damage before entering clonal senescence. When considering population fitness, a system producing different-sized progeny like budding yeast is predicted to benefit from damage retention only at high damage propagation rates. In contrast, the fitness of a system of equal-sized progeny is enhanced by damage segregation regardless of damage propagation rates, suggesting that damage partitioning may also provide an evolutionary advantage in systems dividing by binary fission. Indeed, by using Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model, we experimentally demonstrate that damaged proteins are unevenly partitioned during cytokinesis and the damage-enriched sibling suffers from a prolonged generation time and accelerated aging. This damage retention in S. pombe is, like in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sir2p- and cytoskeleton-dependent, suggesting this to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. We suggest that sibling-specific aging may be a result of the strong selective advantage of damage segregation, which may be more common in nature than previously anticipated.},

The analysis of the PSF is used to determine the resolution of the microscope and to identify any problems with the quality of the microscope's images. The PSF geometry is used as an indicator to identify problems with the objective lens, confocal laser scanning components and other relay optics. Identification of possible causes of PSF abnormalities and solutions to improve microscope performance are provided. The microsphere sample preparation requires 2–3 h plus an overnight drying period.

We recently identified the ER–mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) tethering complex, which plays a role in phospholipid exchange between the two organelles. ERMES also has been implicated in the coordination of mitochondrial protein import, mitochondrial DNA replication, and mitochondrial dynamics, suggesting that these interorganelle contact sites play central regulatory roles in coordinating various aspects of the physiology of the two organelles. Here we purified ERMES complexes and identified the Ca2+-binding Miro GTPase Gem1 as an integral component of ERMES. Gem1 regulates the number and size of the ERMES complexes. In vivo, association of Gem1 to ERMES required the first of Gem1’s two GTPase domains and the first of its two functional Ca2+-binding domains. In contrast, Gem1’s second GTPase domain was required for proper ERMES function in phospholipid exchange. Our results suggest that ERMES is not a passive conduit for interorganellar lipid exchange, but that it can be regulated in response to physiological needs. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the metazoan Gem1 ortholog Miro-1 localizes to sites of ER–mitochondrial contact, suggesting that some of the features ascribed to Gem1 may be evolutionarily conserved.},

We established a model of CR in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this system, lifespan can be extended by limiting glucose or by reducing the activity of the glucose-sensing cyclic-AMP-dependent kinase (PKA). Lifespan extension in a mutant with reduced PKA activity requires Sir2 and NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). In this study we explore how CR activates Sir2 to extend lifespan. Here we show that the shunting of carbon metabolism toward the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and the concomitant increase in respiration play a central part in this process. We discuss how this metabolic strategy may apply to CR in animals.},

	issn = {0021-9525},
	abstract = {An hypothesis considering mitochondria as intracellular power-transmitting protonic cables was tested in human fibroblasts where mitochondria are thin and long and in rat cardiomyocytes where they show cluster organization. Mitochondria in the cell were specifically stained with fluorescent-penetrating cation ethylrhodamine, which electrophoretically accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix. A 40-micron-long mitochondrial filament of fibroblast was illuminated by a very narrow (less than or equal to 0.5 micron) laser beam to induce local damage of the mitochondrial membranes. Such a treatment was found to induce quenching of the ethylrhodamine fluorescence in the entire filament. According to the electron microscope examination, the laser-treated filament retained its continuity after the laser illumination. Other mitochondrial filaments (some of which were localized at a distance less than 10 micron from the laser-treated one) remained fluorescent. In a cell where mitochondrial filaments seemed to be united in a network, laser illumination of one filament resulted in fluorescence quenching in the whole network, whereas fluorescence of small mitochondria not connected with the network was unaffected. The illumination of cardiomyocyte was found to result in the fluorescence quenching not only in a laser-illuminated mitochondrion but also in a large cluster of organelles composed of many mitochondria. Electron microscopy showed that all the mitochondria in the cluster change from the orthodox to the condensed state. It was also found that mitochondria in the cluster are connected to one another with specific junctions. If a mitochondrion did not form junctions with a quenched cluster, its fluorescence was not decreased even when this mitochondrion was localized close to an illuminated one. The size of the mitochondrial cluster may be as long as 50 micron. The cluster is formed by branched chains of contacting mitochondria, which may be defined as Streptio mitochondriale. In the cardiomyocyte there are several mitochondrial clusters or, alternatively, the quenched cluster is a result of decomposition of a supercluster uniting all the mitochondria of the cell. Cluster organization of mitochondria could also be revealed when a single mitochondrion was punctured in situ with a microcapillary. The obtained data are in agreement with the idea that mitochondrial junctions are H+ permeable so that, within the cluster, delta psi may be transmitted from one mitochondrion to another. The above results are consistent with the assumption that mitochondrial filaments or networks represent a united electrical system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The mitochondrial life cycle consists of frequent fusion and fission events. Ample experimental and clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of either fusion or fission results in deterioration of mitochondrial bioenergetics. While fusion may benefit mitochondrial function by allowing the spreading of metabolites, protein and DNA throughout the network, the functional benefit of fission is not as intuitive. Remarkably, studies that track individual mitochondria through fusion and fission found that the two events are paired and that fusion triggers fission. On average each mitochondrion would go though {\textasciitilde}\&\#xa0;5 fusion:fission cycles every hour. Measurement of Δψm during single fusion and fission events demonstrates that fission may yield uneven daughter mitochondria where the depolarized daughter is less likely to become involved in a subsequent fusion and is more likely to be targeted by autophagy. Based on these observations we propose a mechanism by which the integration of mitochondrial fusion, fission and autophagy forms a quality maintenance mechanism. According to this hypothesis pairs of fusion and fission allow for the reorganization and sequestration of damaged mitochondrial components into daughter mitochondria that are segregated from the networking pool and then becoming eliminated by autophagy.},

It is now feasible for laboratories to acquire and analyze high-resolution multidimensional images of yeast and structures within yeast, including mitochondria. As mitochondria cannot be detected in yeast using transmitted-light microscopy (phase-contrast or differential interference contrast), methods have been developed to visualize the organelle with vital fluorescent dyes, immunofluorescence, or targeted fluorescent proteins (FPs). For studies of morphology and dynamics of mitochondrial membranes, the laboratory uses FPs targeted to the matrix or the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. FPs can be targeted to mitochondria by two methods both of which employ fusion proteins. One approach relies on ectopic expression of fusion proteins consisting of mitochondrial signal sequences fused to FPs. The other method is the fusion of FPs to endogenous mitochondrial proteins. Signal sequences contain all the information that is required for import of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. They may reside at the N-terminus, C-terminus, or within nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial signal sequences have been used to target FPs to mitochondria and specific compartments within mitochondria. The chapter discusses several plasmid-borne targeted FPs to label yeast mitochondria. All of the targeted FPs used produces a robust fluorescent signal that is specific for mitochondria and have no deleterious effect on cell growth or on mitochondrial morphology, motility, or respiratory activity. Applications and outcomes for each of the commonly used approaches are also summarized in the chapter.},

	abstract = {Mutations and deletions in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) cause human disease, and are thought to play an important role the aging process. Despite this, relatively little is known about how mitochondrial dysfunction leads to cellular pathology. We have used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to understand cellular consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction, and we have discovered a novel phenomenon that occurs when the mtDNA is damaged or lost. We found that loss of the mtDNA in yeast leads to a crisis characterized by a progressive onset of slow growth and cell inviability, and an increase in nuclear genomic instability. We found that this crisis is not caused by the loss of respiration, which is the most obvious consequence of mtDNA loss, but rather to a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential that occurs when cells lose their mtDNA. This in turn leads to decreased mitochondrial protein import, and loss of function in non-respiratory mitochondrial processes. Expression analysis of cells going through this crisis suggested a defect in an evolutionarily conserved process that occurs in the mitochondrial matrix: the biogenesis of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) proteins. This mitochondrial pathway is essential because of its requirement for the function of non-mitochondrial ISC proteins, several of which have important roles in nuclear genome maintenance. We find that down-regulation of non-mitochondrial ISC protein biogenesis leads to a similar phenotype of progressive slow growth and increased nuclear recombination. While it has been known for decades that the phenotype of cells without mtDNA in yeast is not fully explained by the loss of respiration, this is to our knowledge the first identification of a specific mitochondrial pathway that is altered in these cells, and how this alteration leads to cellular dysfunction, including nuclear genomic instability. The role of the mtDNA in maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as the essential role of the mitochondria in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, are both conserved from yeast cells to human cells. This raises the possibility that dysfunctional iron metabolism could play a role in human mitochondrial disease.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate whether and how a modification of mitochondrial metabolism can affect yeast sensitivity to programmed cell death (PCD) induced by acetic acid (AA-PCD), yeast cells were grown on raffinose, as a sole carbon source, which, differently from glucose, favours mitochondrial respiration. We found that, differently from glucose-grown cells, raffinose-grown cells were mostly resistant to AA-PCD and that this was due to the activation of mitochondrial retrograde (RTG) response, which increased with time, as revealed by the up-regulation of the peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase isoform 1, RTG pathway target genes. Accordingly, the deletion of RTG2 and RTG3, a positive regulator and a transcription factor of the RTG pathway, resulted in AA-PCD, as shown by TUNEL assay. Neither deletion in raffinose-grown cells of HAP4, encoding the positive regulatory subunit of the Hap2,3,4,5 complex nor constitutive activation of the RTG pathway in glucose-grown cells due to deletion of MKS1, a negative regulator of RTG pathway, had effect on yeast AA-PCD. The RTG pathway was found to be activated in yeast cells containing mitochondria, in which membrane potential was measured, capable to consume oxygen in a manner stimulated by the uncoupler CCCP and inhibited by the respiratory chain inhibitor antimycin A. AA-PCD resistance in raffinose-grown cells occurs with a decrease in both ROS production and cytochrome c release as compared to glucose-grown cells en route to AA-PCD.},

The UCP uncouples mitochondrial respiration from ATP production by introducing a proton conducting pathway through the mitochondrial inner membrane. The activity of the UCP is regulated: nucleotide binding to the UCP inhibits proton conductance whereas free fatty acids increase it. The similarities between the UCP, the ADP/ATP carrier and the DNA recognition element found in the DNA binding domain of the estrogen receptor suggested that these proteins could share common features in their respective interactions with free nucleotides or DNA, and thus defined a putative 'nucleotide recognition element' in the UCP. This article provides demonstration of the validity of this hypothesis. The putative nucleotide recognition element corresponding to the amino acids 261-269 of the UCP was gradually destroyed, and these mutant proteins were expressed in yeast. Flow cytometry, measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo, showed increased uncoupling activities of these mutant proteins, and was corroborated with studies with isolated mitochondria. The deletion of the three amino acids Phe267, Lys268 and Gly269, resulted in a mutant where proton leak could be activated by fatty acids but not inhibited by nucleotides.},

We hypothesized that Antarctic icefishes, lacking the oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin, might be more vulnerable to temperature-induced oxidative stress compared with red-blooded notothenioids because of differences in their mitochondrial properties. Mitochondria from icefishes have higher densities of phospholipids per mg of mitochondrial protein compared with red-blooded species, and these phospholipids are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which can promote the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, previous studies have shown that multiple tissues in icefishes have lower levels of antioxidants compared with red-blooded species. We quantified several properties of mitochondria, including proton leak, rates of ROS production, membrane composition and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation (LPO), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant power (TAOP) in mitochondria isolated from hearts of icefishes and red-blooded notothenioids. Mitochondria from icefishes were more tightly coupled than those of red-blooded fishes at both 2°C and 10°C, which increased the production of ROS when the electron transport chain was disrupted. The activity of SOD and TAOP per mg of mitochondrial protein was equivalent between icefishes and red-blooded species, but TAOP normalized to mitochondrial phospholipid content was significantly lower in icefishes compared with red-blooded fishes. Additionally, membrane susceptibility to peroxidation was only detectable in icefishes at 1°C and not in red-blooded species. Together, our results suggest that the high density of mitochondrial phospholipids in hearts of icefishes may make them particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress as temperatures rise.},

Distinct import signals within precursors direct each protein to the mitochondrial surface and subsequently onto specific transport routes to its final destination within these organelles. In this review we highlight common principles of mitochondrial protein import and address different mechanisms of protein integration into mitochondrial membranes. Over the last years it has become clear that mitochondrial protein translocases are not independently operating units, but in fact closely cooperate with each other. We discuss recent studies that indicate how the pathways for mitochondrial protein biogenesis are embedded into a functional network of various other physiological processes, such as energy metabolism, signal transduction, and maintenance of mitochondrial morphology.

These include two blue, seven green, and seven red fluorescent proteins, which we have assessed for brightness, photostability and perturbation of tagged proteins. We find that EGFP remains the best performing green fluorescent protein, that TagRFP-T and mRuby2 outperform mCherry as red fluorescent proteins, and that mTagBFP2 can be used as a blue fluorescent protein tag.

First, we determined the effect of mitochondrial fission on energy production by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting DRP1, which revealed the importance of membrane fluidity on the control of bioenergetics. Second, we followed the effect of rotenone, a specific inhibitor of respiratory chain complex I, which causes large structural perturbations, once a threshold was reached. Last, we followed changes in the mitochondrial network configuration in human cells that had been treated with modulators of oxidative phosphorylation, and in fibroblasts from two patients with mitochondrial disease where the respiratory rate, ΔΨ and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. Our data demonstrate that the relationship between mitochondrial network organization and bioenergetics is bidirectional, and we provide a model for analyzing the metabolic signals involved in this crosstalk.},

However, whereas Mfn2 mutant embryos have a specific and severe disruption of the placental trophoblast giant cell layer, Mfn1-deficient giant cells are normal. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn1 or Mfn2 display distinct types of fragmented mitochondria, a phenotype we determine to be due to a severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, we find that Mfn1 and Mfn2 form homotypic and heterotypic complexes and show, by rescue of mutant cells, that the homotypic complexes are functional for fusion. We conclude that Mfn1 and Mfn2 have both redundant and distinct functions and act in three separate molecular complexes to promote mitochondrial fusion. Strikingly, a subset of mitochondria in mutant cells lose membrane potential. Therefore, mitochondrial fusion is essential for embryonic development, and by enabling cooperation between mitochondria, has protective effects on the mitochondrial population.},

Mitochondrial inheritance, the transfer of mitochondria from mother to daughter cell during cell division, is essential for daughter cell viability. The mitochore, a mitochondrial protein complex containing Mdm10p, Mdm12p, and Mmm1p, is required for mitochondrial motility leading to inheritance in budding yeast. We observe a defect in cytokinesis in mitochore mutants and another mutant (mmr1Δ gem1Δ) with impaired mitochondrial inheritance. This defect is not observed in yeast that have no mitochondrial DNA or defects in mitochondrial protein import or assembly of β-barrel proteins in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Deletion of MDM10 inhibits contractile-ring closure, but does not inhibit contractile-ring assembly, localization of a chromosomal passenger protein to the spindle during early anaphase, spindle alignment, nucleolar segregation, or nuclear migration during anaphase. Release of the mitotic exit network (MEN) component, Cdc14p, from the nucleolus during anaphase is delayed in mdm10Δ cells. Finally, hyperactivation of the MEN by deletion of BUB2 restores defects in cytokinesis in mdm10Δ and mmr1Δ gem1Δ cells and reduces the fidelity of mitochondrial segregation between mother and daughter cells in wild-type and mdm10Δ cells. Our studies identify a novel MEN-linked regulatory system that inhibits cytokinesis in response to defects in mitochondrial inheritance in budding yeast.},

In conjunction with nonlinear image restoration, we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, three-dimensional imaging of live eukaryotic cells at an equilateral resolution of ≈100 nm. This imaging mode allowed us to reveal the morphology and size of the green fluorescent protein-labeled mitochondrial compartment of live Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast) growing on different carbon sources. Our studies show that mitochondria of cells grown on medium containing glycerol as the only carbon source, as opposed to glucose-grown cells, exhibit a strongly branched tubular reticulum. We determine the average tubular diameter and find that it increases from 339 ± 5 nm to 360 ± 4 nm when changing from glucose to glycerol, that is, from a fermentable to a nonfermentable carbon source. Moreover, this change is associated with a 2.8-fold increase of the surface of the reticulum, resulting in an average increase in volume of the mitochondrial compartment by a factor of 3.0 ± 0.2.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial oxidative damage contributes to a wide range of pathologies, and lipid peroxidation of the mitochondrial inner membrane is a major component of this disruption. However, despite its importance, there are no methods to assess mitochondrial lipid peroxidation within cells specifically. To address this unmet need we have developed a ratiometric, fluorescent, mitochondria-targeted lipid peroxidation probe, MitoPerOx. This compound is derived from the C11-BODIPY581/591 probe, which contains a boron dipyromethane difluoride (BODIPY) fluorophore conjugated via a dienyl link to a phenyl group. In response to lipid peroxidation the fluorescence emission maximum shifts from ∼590 to ∼520\&\#xa0;nm. To target this probe to the matrix-facing surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane we attached a triphenylphosphonium lipophilic cation, which leads to its selective uptake into mitochondria in cells, driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential. Here we report on the development and characterization of MitoPerOx. We found that MitoPerOx was taken up very rapidly into mitochondria within cells, where it responded to changes in mitochondrial lipid peroxidation that could be measured by fluorimetry, confocal microscopy, and epifluorescence live cell imaging. Importantly, the peroxidation-sensitive change in fluorescence at 520\&\#xa0;nm relative to that at 590\&\#xa0;nm enabled the use of the probe as a ratiometric fluorescent probe, greatly facilitating assessment of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation in cells.},

Since the redox balance must be maintained, it has been postulated that NAD(P)H reoxidation is accelerated by the activation of energy-dissipating reactions, which would, in turn, explain the low growth efficiencies observed. It has been demonstrated already in S. cerevisiae cultures that these putative energy-dissipating reactions are stimulated both by oxygen and high cytosolic ATP levels. In this paper, we show that ATP induces a proton-permeability pathway in mitochondria at concentrations which are within the physiological range, as revealed both from the ATP stimulation of respiration and from the induction of H+ -dependent swelling. We also demonstrate that phosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor of the nucleotide, and since activation is observed even in the presence of atractylate, we postulate that the ATP-binding site is located in the outer face of the mitochondrial inner membrane.},

	abstract = {Cristae, the organized invaginations of the mitochondrial inner membrane, respond structurally to the energetic demands of the cell. The mechanism by which these dynamic changes are regulated and the consequences thereof are largely unknown. Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is the mitochondrial GTPase responsible for inner membrane fusion and maintenance of cristae structure. Here, we report that OPA1 responds dynamically to changes in energetic conditions to regulate cristae structure. This cristae regulation is independent of OPA1's role in mitochondrial fusion, since an OPA1 mutant that can still oligomerize but has no fusion activity was able to maintain cristae structure. Importantly, OPA1 was required for resistance to starvation-induced cell death, for mitochondrial respiration, for growth in galactose media and for maintenance of ATP synthase assembly, independently of its fusion activity. We identified mitochondrial solute carriers (SLC25A) as OPA1 interactors and show that their pharmacological and genetic blockade inhibited OPA1 oligomerization and function. Thus, we propose a novel way in which OPA1 senses energy substrate availability, which modulates its function in the regulation of mitochondrial architecture in a SLC25A protein-dependent manner.},

Here we report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of mtDNA leads to nuclear genome instability, through a process of cell cycle arrest and selection we define as a cellular crisis. This crisis is not mediated by the absence of respiration, but instead correlates with a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of cells undergoing this crisis identified a defect in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis, which requires normal mitochondrial function. We found that down-regulation of non-mitochondrial ISC protein biogenesis was sufficient to cause increased genomic instability in cells with intact mitochondrial function. These results suggest mitochondrial dysfunction stimulates nuclear genome instability by inhibiting the production of ISC-containing protein(s), which are required for maintenance of nuclear genome integrity.},

CR is frequently used as a tool to understand mechanisms behind ageing and age-associated diseases. In addition to and independently of increasing lifespan, CR has been reported to delay or prevent the occurrence of many chronic diseases in a variety of animals. Beneficial effects of CR on outcomes such as immune function, motor coordination and resistance to sarcopenia in rhesus monkeys have recently been reported. We report here that a CR regimen implemented in young and older age rhesus monkeys at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has not improved survival outcomes. Our findings contrast with an ongoing study at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC), which reported improved survival associated with 30\% CR initiated in adult rhesus monkeys (7–14 years) and a preliminary report with a small number of CR monkeys. Over the years, both NIA and WNPRC have extensively documented beneficial health effects of CR in these two apparently parallel studies. The implications of the WNPRC findings were important as they extended CR findings beyond the laboratory rodent and to a long-lived primate. Our study suggests a separation between health effects, morbidity and mortality, and similar to what has been shown in rodents, study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived nonhuman primate.},

	abstract = {In the intracellular microenvironment of active muscle tissue, high rates of respiration are maintained at near-limiting oxygen concentrations. The respiration of isolated heart mitochondria is a hyperbolic function of oxygen concentration and half-maximal rates were obtained at 0.4 and 0.7 microM O(2) with substrates for the respiratory chain (succinate) and cytochrome c oxidase [N,N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD)+ascorbate] respectively at 30 degrees C and with maximum ADP stimulation (State 3). The respiratory response of cytochrome c-depleted mitoplasts to external cytochrome c was biphasic with TMPD, but showed a monophasic hyperbolic function with succinate. Half-maximal stimulation of respiration was obtained at 0.4 microM cytochrome c, which was nearly identical to the high-affinity K(')(m) for cytochrome c of cytochrome c oxidase supplied with TMPD. The capacity of cytochrome c oxidase in the presence of TMPD was 2-fold higher than the capacity of the respiratory chain with succinate, measured at environmental normoxic levels. This apparent excess capacity, however, is significantly decreased under physiological intracellular oxygen conditions and declines steeply under hypoxic conditions. Similarly, the excess capacity of cytochrome c oxidase declines with progressive cytochrome c depletion. The flux control coefficient of cytochrome c oxidase, therefore, increases as a function of substrate limitation of oxygen and cytochrome c, which suggests a direct functional role for the apparent excess capacity of cytochrome c oxidase in hypoxia and under conditions of intracellular accumulation of cytochrome c after its release from mitochondria.},

We measured the relationship between respiration rate and membrane potential as respiration was titrated by the addition of malonate under each condition. We used the flux control summation and connectivity theorems and the branching theorem of metabolic control theory to calculate the control over respiration rate exerted by the respiratory chain (and associated reactions), phosphorylating system (and associated reactions) and proton leak at each respiration rate. The analysis also yielded the flux control coefficients of these three reactions over phosphorylation rate and proton leak rate and their concentration control coefficients over protonmotive force. We found that respiration rate was controlled largely by the proton leak under non-phosphorylating conditions, by the phosphorylating system at intermediate rates and by both the phosphorylating system and the respiratory chain in state 3. The rate of phosphorylation was controlled largely by the phosphorylating system itself in state 4 and at intermediate rates, while state 3 control was shared between the phosphorylating system and the respiratory chain; the proton leak had insignificant control. In all states the phosphorylating system had large negative control over the proton leak; the chain and the proton leak both had large positive control coefficients. The protonmotive force was controlled by the chain and by the phosphorylating system; the proton leak had little control.},

The methodology is demonstrated by sensing intracellular oxygen in different mammalian cell lines, including A549, Jurkat, and HeLa, and monitoring rapid and transient changes in response to mitochondrial uncoupling by valinomycin and inhibition by antimycin A. Furthermore, the effect of ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx on cellular oxygen uptake is shown by substantial changes in the level of intracellular oxygen. The results demonstrate the ability of this technique to measure small, rapid, and transient changes in intracellular oxygen in response to different biological effectors. Moreover, this technique has wide ranging applicability in cell biology and is particularly useful in the study of low oxygen environments (cellular hypoxia), mitochondrial and cellular (dys)function, and for therapeutic areas, such as cardiovascular and neurological research, metabolic diseases, and cancer.},

Mitochondria accumulate at neuronal and immunological synapses [1, 2] and yeast bud tips [3] and associate with the ER during phospholipid biosynthesis, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial fission [4, 5]. Here we show that mitochondria are associated with cortical ER (cER) sheets [6, 7] underlying the plasma membrane in the bud tip and confirm that a deletion in YPT11, which inhibits cER accumulation in the bud tip [8], also inhibits bud tip anchorage of mitochondria [9]. Time-lapse imaging reveals that mitochondria are anchored at specific sites in the bud tip. Mmr1p, a member of the DSL1 family of tethering proteins, localizes to punctate structures on opposing surfaces of mitochondria and cER sheets underlying the bud tip and is recovered with isolated mitochondria and ER. Deletion of MMR1 impairs bud tip anchorage of mitochondria without affecting mitochondrial velocity or cER distribution. Deletion of the phosphatase PTC1 results in increased Mmr1p phosphorylation, mislocalization of Mmr1p, defects in association of Mmr1p with mitochondria and ER, and defects in bud tip anchorage of mitochondria. These findings indicate that Mmr1p contributes to mitochondrial inheritance as a mediator of anchorage of mitochondria to cER sheets in the yeast bud tip and that Ptc1p regulates Mmr1p phosphorylation, localization, and function.},

	abstract = {Pioneering biochemical studies have long forged the concept that the mitochondria are the ‘energy powerhouse of the cell’. These studies, combined with the unique evolutionary origin of the mitochondria, led the way to decades of research focusing on the organelle as an essential, yet independent, functional component of the cell. Recently, however, our conceptual view of this isolated organelle has been profoundly altered with the discovery that mitochondria function within an integrated reticulum that is continually remodeled by both fusion and fission events. The identification of a number of proteins that regulate these activities is beginning to provide mechanistic details of mitochondrial membrane remodeling. However, the broader question remains regarding the underlying purpose of mitochondrial dynamics and the translation of these morphological transitions into altered functional output. One hypothesis has been that mitochondrial respiration and metabolism may be spatially and temporally regulated by the architecture and positioning of the organelle. Recent evidence supports and expands this idea by demonstrating that mitochondria are an integral part of multiple cell signaling cascades. Interestingly, proteins such as GTPases, kinases and phosphatases are involved in bi-directional communication between the mitochondrial reticulum and the rest of the cell. These proteins link mitochondrial function and dynamics to the regulation of metabolism, cell-cycle control, development, antiviral responses and cell death. In this review we will highlight the emerging evidence that provides molecular definition to mitochondria as a central platform in the execution of diverse cellular events.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work was to analyze the interactions between oxidative phosphorylations and glucose metabolism on yeast cells aerobically grown on lactate as carbon source and incubated in a resting cell medium. On such respiratory-competent yeast cells, four different metabolic steady states have particularly been studied: (a) glucose feeding under anaerobiosis, (b) ethanol supply under aerobiosis, (c) glucose supply under aerobiosis and (d) glucose plus ethanol under aerobiosis. For each condition, we measured: (a) the cellular ATP/ADP ratio and NADH content sustained under these conditions, (b) the glucose consumption rate (glucose conditions) and the respiratory rate (aerobic conditions). Under aerobic conditions, when ethanol is used as substrate, the ATP/ADP ratio and NADH level are very high as compared with glucose feeding. However, the rate of oxygen consumption is similar under both conditions. The main observation is a large increase in the respiratory rate when both glucose and ethanol are added. This increase corresponds to an ATP/ADP ratio and a NADH level lower than those observed with ethanol but higher than those with glucose. Therefore the response of the respiratory rate to the ATP/ADP ratio depends on the redox potential. We studied the way in which the ATP-consuming activity was increased under glucose + ethanol conditions. By NMR experiments, it appears that neither the futile cycle at the level of the phosphofructo-1-kinase/fructo-1,6-bisphosphatase couple nor the synthesis of carbohydrate stores could account for the increase in oxidative phosphorylation. However, it is shown that, in the presence of glucose + ethanol, ATP consumption is strongly stimulated. It is hypothesized that this consumption is essentially due to the combination of the well-known plasma membrane proton-ATPase activation by glucose and the high phosphate potential due to oxidative ethanol metabolism. While it is well documented that oxidative phosphorylations inhibit the glycolytic flux, i.e. the Pasteur effect, we clearly show in this work that the glycolytic pathway limits the ability of mitochondria to maintain a cellular phosphate potential.},

	abstract = {Natural environments are filled with multiple, often competing, signals. In contrast, biological systems are often studied in “well-controlled” environments where only a single input is varied, potentially missing important interactions between signals. Catabolite repression of galactose by glucose is one of the best-studied eukaryotic signal integration systems. In this system, it is believed that galactose metabolic (GAL) genes are induced only when glucose levels drop below a threshold. In contrast, we show that GAL gene induction occurs at a constant external galactose:glucose ratio across a wide range of sugar concentrations. We systematically perturbed the components of the canonical galactose/glucose signaling pathways and found that these components do not account for ratio sensing. Instead we provide evidence that ratio sensing occurs upstream of the canonical signaling pathway and results from the competitive binding of the two sugars to hexose transporters. We show that a mutant that behaves as the classical model expects (i.e., cannot use galactose above a glucose threshold) has a fitness disadvantage compared with wild type. A number of common biological signaling motifs can give rise to ratio sensing, typically through negative interactions between opposing signaling molecules. We therefore suspect that this previously unidentified nutrient sensing paradigm may be common and overlooked in biology.},

In addition to this NADH dehydrogenase,S. cerevisiae exhibits another mitochondrial NADH-dehydrogenase activity, which oxidizes NADH at the cytosolic side of the inner membrane. To investigate whether open reading framesYMR145c/NDE1 and YDL 085w/NDE2, which exhibit sequence similarity with NDI1, encode the latter enzyme, NADH-dependent mitochondrial respiration was assayed in wild-type S. cerevisiae and nde deletion mutants. Mitochondria were isolated from aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a dilution rate (D) of 0.10 h−1, in which reoxidation of cytosolic NADH by wild-type cells occurred exclusively by respiration. Compared with the wild type, rates of mitochondrial NADH oxidation were about 3-fold reduced in annde1Δ mutant and unaffected in an nde2Δmutant. NADH-dependent mitochondrial respiration was completely abolished in an nde1Δ nde2Δ double mutant. Mitochondrial respiration of substrates other than NADH was not affected in nde mutants. In shake flasks, an nde1Δ nde2Δ mutant exhibited reduced specific growth rates on ethanol and galactose but not on glucose. Glucose metabolism in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures (D = 0.10 h−1) of an nde1Δ nde2Δ mutant was essentially respiratory. Apparently, under these conditions alternative systems for reoxidation of cytosolic NADH could replace the role of Nde1p and Nde2p in S. cerevisiae.},

The essential attributes of these dyes include membrane permeability, low membrane binding, spectral properties which are insensitive to environment, and, of course, strong fluorescence. A series of dyes were screened on HeLa cells for their ability to meet these criteria and several commercially available dyes were found to be satisfactory. In addition, two new dyes were synthesized for this work by esterification of tetramethyl rhodamine. The analysis of the measured fluorescent intensities requires correction for fluorescence collected from outside the plane of focus of the cell and for nonpotentiometric binding of the dye. The measurements and analysis were performed on three different cell types for which there exists a body of literature on membrane potential; the potentials determined in this work were always within the range of literature values. The rhodamine esters are nontoxic, highly fluorescent dyes which do not form aggregates or display binding-dependent changes in fluorescence efficiency. Thus, their reversible accumulation is quantitatively related to the contrast between intracellular and extracellular fluorescence and allows membrane potentials in individual cells to be continuously monitored.},

	abstract = {Bacterial physiological responses integrate energy-coupling processes at the membrane level with metabolic energy demand. The regulatory design behind these responses remains largely unexplored. Propionigenium modestum is an adequate organism to study these responses because it presents the simplest scheme known integrating membrane potential generation and metabolic ATP consumption. A hypothetical sodium leak is added to the scheme as the sole regulatory site. Allosteric regulation is assumed to be absent. Information of the rate equations is not available. However, relevant features of the patterns of responses may be obtained using Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) and Metabolic Control Design (MCD). With these tools, we show that membrane potential disturbances can be compensated by adjusting the leak flux, without significant perturbations of ATP consumption. Perturbations of membrane potential by ATP demand are inevitable and also require compensatory changes in the leak. Numerical simulations were performed with a kinetic model exhibiting the responses for small changes obtained with MCA and MCD. A modest leak (10\% of input) was assumed for the reference state. We found that disturbances in membrane potential and ATP consumption, produced by environmental perturbations of the cation concentration, may be reverted to the reference state adjusting the leak. Leak changes can also compensate for undesirable effects on membrane potential produced by changes in nutrient availability or ATP demand, in a wide range of values. The system is highly robust to parameter fluctuations. The regulatory role of energy dissipating processes and the trade-off between energetic efficiency and regulatory capacity are discussed.},

It is well established that changes in mitochondrial metabolism influence mitochondrial shape and matrix configuration. We demonstrated previously that inhibition of mitochondrial complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) by rotenone accelerated matrix protein diffusion and decreased the fraction and velocity of moving mitochondria. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between inherited CI deficiency, mitochondrial shape, mobility, and matrix protein diffusion. To this end, we analyzed fibroblasts of two children that represented opposite extremes in a cohort of 16 patients, with respect to their residual CI activity and mitochondrial shape. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) revealed no relationship between residual CI activity, mitochondrial shape, the fraction of moving mitochondria, their velocity, and the rate of matrix-targeted enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (mitoEYFP) diffusion. However, mitochondrial velocity and matrix protein diffusion in moving mitochondria were two to three times higher in patient cells than in control cells. Nocodazole inhibited mitochondrial movement without altering matrix EYFP diffusion, suggesting that both activities are mutually independent. Unexpectedly, electron microscopy analysis revealed no differences in mitochondrial ultrastructure between control and patient cells. It is discussed that the matrix of a moving mitochondrion in the CI-deficient state becomes less dense, allowing faster metabolite diffusion, and that fibroblasts of CI-deficient patients become more glycolytic, allowing a higher mitochondrial velocity.},

Mitochondria from heterozygous mice, with a partial deficiency in MnSOD, showed evidence of increased proton leak, inhibition of respiration, and early and rapid accumulation of mitochondrial oxidative damage. Furthermore, chronic oxidative stress in the heterozygous mice resulted in an increased sensitization of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the premature induction of apoptosis, which presumably eliminates the cells with damaged mitochondria. Mice with normal MnSOD levels show the same age-related mitochondrial decline as the heterozygotes but occurring later in life. The premature decline in mitochondrial function in the heterozygote was associated with the compensatory up-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation enzyme activity. Thus mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, oxidative stress, functional decline, and the initiation of apoptosis appear to be central components of the aging process.},

	abstract = {Reliable optical detection of single action potentials in mammalian neurons has been one of the longest-standing challenges in neuroscience. Here we achieved this goal by using the endogenous fluorescence of a microbial rhodopsin protein, Archaerhodopsin 3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense, expressed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. This genetically encoded voltage indicator exhibited an approximately tenfold improvement in sensitivity and speed over existing protein-based voltage indicators, with a roughly linear twofold increase in brightness between −150 mV and +150 mV and a sub-millisecond response time. Arch detected single electrically triggered action potentials with an optical signal-to-noise ratio {\textgreater}10. Arch(D95N) lacked endogenous proton pumping and had 50\% greater sensitivity than wild type but had a slower response (41 ms). Nonetheless, Arch(D95N) also resolved individual action potentials. Microbial rhodopsin–based voltage indicators promise to enable optical interrogation of complex neural circuits and electrophysiology in systems for which electrode-based techniques are challenging.},

During mitosis in most eukaryotic cells, chromosomes align and form a metaphase plate halfway between the spindle poles, about which they exhibit oscillatory movement. These movements are accompanied by changes in the distance between sister kinetochores, commonly referred to as breathing. We developed a live cell imaging assay combined with computational image analysis to quantify the properties and dynamics of sister kinetochores in three dimensions. We show that baseline oscillation and breathing speeds in late prometaphase and metaphase are set by microtubule depolymerases, whereas oscillation and breathing periods depend on the stiffness of the mechanical linkage between sisters. Metaphase plates become thinner as cells progress toward anaphase as a result of reduced oscillation speed at a relatively constant oscillation period. The progressive slowdown of oscillation speed and its coupling to plate thickness depend nonlinearly on the stiffness of the mechanical linkage between sisters. We propose that metaphase plate formation and thinning require tight control of the state of the mechanical linkage between sisters mediated by centromeric chromatin and cohesion.},

The models reveal an inner membrane consisting of two components, the inner boundary membrane (IBM) closely apposed to the outer membrane and the cristae membrane that projects into the matrix compartment. These two components are connected by tubular structures of relatively uniform size called crista junctions. The distribution of crista junction sizes and shapes is predicted by a thermodynamic model based upon the energy of membrane bending, but proteins likely also play a role in determining the conformation of the inner membrane. Results of structural studies of mitochondria during apoptosis demonstrate that cytochrome c is released without detectable disruption of the outer membrane or extensive swelling of the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting the formation of an outer membrane pore large enough to allow passage of holo-cytochrome c. The possible compartmentation of inner membrane function between the IBM and the cristae membrane is also discussed.},

Here, we establish an in vivo method using a novel electrochemical O2− sensor. O2− generated is measured as a current and evaluated as a quantified partial value of electricity (Qpart), which is calculated by integration of the difference between the baseline and the actual reacted current. The accuracy and efficacy of this method were confirmed by dose-dependent O2− generation in xanthine–xanthine oxidase in vitro in phosphate-buffered saline and human blood. It was then applied to endotoxemic rats in vivo. O2− current began to increase 1 h after lipopolysaccharide, and Qpart increased significantly for 6 h in endotoxemic rats, in comparison to sham-treated rats. These values were attenuated by superoxide dismutase. The generation and attenuation of O2− were indirectly confirmed by plasma lipid peroxidation with malondialdehyde, endothelial injury with soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and microcirculatory dysfunction. This is a novel method for measuring O2− in vivo and could be used to monitor and treat the pathophysiology caused by excessive O2− generation in animals and humans.},

Human ECV304 cells transiently transfected with MIMS-EYFP showed the typical mitochondrial network, co-localized with MitoTracker Red. Following the calibration procedure, an estimation of the pH value in the intermembrane space was obtained. This value (6.88\&\#xa0;±\&\#xa0;0.09) was significantly lower than that determined in the cytosol after transfection with a cytosolic EYFP (7.59\&\#xa0;±\&\#xa0;0.01). Further, the pH of the mitochondrial matrix, determined with a EYFP targeted to this subcompartment, was 0.9 pH units higher than that in the intermembrane space.

	abstract = {Respirometry using modified cell culture microplates offers an increase in throughput and a decrease in biological material required for each assay. Plate based respirometers are susceptible to a range of diffusion phenomena; as O(2) is consumed by the specimen, atmospheric O(2) leaks into the measurement volume. Oxygen also dissolves in and diffuses passively through the polystyrene commonly used as a microplate material. Consequently the walls of such respirometer chambers are not just permeable to O(2) but also store substantial amounts of gas. O(2) flux between the walls and the measurement volume biases the measured oxygen consumption rate depending on the actual [O(2)] gradient. We describe a compartment model-based correction algorithm to deconvolute the biological oxygen consumption rate from the measured [O(2)]. We optimize the algorithm to work with the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer. The correction algorithm is biologically validated using mouse cortical synaptosomes and liver mitochondria attached to XF24 V7 cell culture microplates, and by comparison to classical Clark electrode oxygraph measurements. The algorithm increases the useful range of oxygen consumption rates, the temporal resolution, and durations of measurements. The algorithm is presented in a general format and is therefore applicable to other respirometer systems.},

This model is constructed based on detailed kinetics and thermodynamically balanced reaction mechanisms and a strict accounting of rapidly equilibrating biochemical species. Since building such a model requires introducing a large number of adjustable kinetic parameters, a correspondingly large amount of independent data from isolated mitochondria respiring on different substrates and subject to a variety of protocols is used to parameterize the model and ensure that it is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The developed model is further validated by both in vitro data on isolated cardiac mitochondria and in vivo experimental measurements on human skeletal muscle. The validated model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP in regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase fluxes, demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator. Further model predictions reveal that a decrease of cytosolic pH value results in decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding drop in the ability of the mitochondria to synthesize ATP at the hydrolysis potential required for cellular function.},

	abstract = {Turnover of mitochondria by autophagy constitutes an essential quality maintenance mechanism. Recent studies have demonstrated that efficient clearance of damaged mitochondrial components depends on mitochondrial dynamics, a process characterized by frequent fusion and fission events that enable the redistribution of mitochondrial components across a population of hundreds of individual mitochondria. The presented simulation identifies kinetic parameters of fusion and fission that may influence the maintenance of mitochondrial function. The program simulated repetitive cycles of fusion and fission events in which intact and damaged mitochondrial contents were redistributed between fusion mates. Redistribution impacted mitochondrial function, thereby influencing the fate of each mitochondrion, to be either destined for a subsequent fusion or eliminated by autophagy. Our findings indicate that, when paired with fission, fusion events may serve to accelerate the removal of damaged mitochondrial components by autophagy. The model predicts the existence of an optimal frequency of fusion and fission events that can maintain respiratory function at steady-state levels amid the existence of a continuous damaging process that inactivates mitochondrial components. A further elevation of the fusion frequency can increase the clearance efficiency of damaged content. However, this requires fusion to be a selective process in which depolarized mitochondria are excluded from the fusing population. The selectivity of fusion was found to be particularly beneficial in conditions of elevated rate of damage, because it permits the increase of fusion frequency without compromising the removal of damaged content by autophagy.},

With excitation and emission maxima at 558 nm and 605 nm, respectively, and a large Stokes shift of 47 nm, mRuby appears particularly useful for imaging applications. The protein shows an exceptional resistance to denaturation at pH extremes. Moreover, mRuby is about ten-fold brighter compared to EGFP when being targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. The engineering process of eqFP611 revealed that the C-terminal tail of the protein acts as a natural peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS). Using an mRuby variant carrying the eqFP611-PTS, we discovered that ordered inheritance of peroxisomes is widespread during mitosis of different mammalian cell types. The ordered partitioning is realized by the formation of peroxisome clusters around the poles of the mitotic spindle and ensures that equal numbers of the organelle are inherited by the daughter cells. The unique spectral properties make mRuby the marker of choice for a multitude of cell biological applications. Moreover, the use of mRuby has allowed novel insights in the biology of organelles responsible for severe human diseases.},

	abstract = {Autophagy is a catabolic membrane-trafficking process that occurs in all eukaryotic cells and leads to the hydrolytic degradation of cytosolic material in the vacuolar or lysosomal lumen. Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting mitochondria, is poorly understood at present. Several recent reports suggest that mitophagy is a selective process that targets damaged mitochondria, whereas other studies imply a role for mitophagy in cell death processes. In a screen for protein phosphatase homologs that functionally interact with the autophagy-dedicated protein kinase Atg1p in yeast, we have identified Aup1p, encoded by Saccharomyces cerevisiae reading frame YCR079w. Aup1p is highly similar to a family of protein phosphatase homologs in animal cells that are predicted to localize to mitochondria based on sequence analysis. Interestingly, we found that Aup1p localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is required for efficient mitophagy in stationary phase cells. Viability studies demonstrate that Aup1p is required for efficient survival of cells in prolonged stationary phase cultures, implying a pro-survival role for mitophagy under our working conditions. Our data suggest that Aup1p may be part of a signal transduction mechanism that marks mitochondria for sequestration into autophagosomes.},

Here we present a simple method for the simultaneous quantification of mitochondrial membrane potential and network morphology that is based on computational co-localisation analysis of differentially imported fluorescent marker proteins. Established in, but not restricted to, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MitoLoc reproducibly measures changes in membrane potential induced by the uncoupling agent CCCP, by oxidative stress, in respiratory deficient cells, and in ∆fzo1, ∆ref2, and ∆dnm1 mutants that possess fission and fusion defects. In combination with super-resolution images, MitoLoc uses 3D reconstruction to calculate six geometrical classifiers which differentiate network morphologies in ∆fzo1, ∆ref2, and ∆dnm1 mutants, under oxidative stress and in cells lacking mtDNA, even when the network is fragmented to a similar extent. We find that mitochondrial fission and a decline in membrane potential do regularly, but not necessarily, co-occur. MitoLoc hence simplifies the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential in parallel to detect morphological changes in mitochondrial networks. Marker plasmid open-source software as well as the mathematical procedures are made openly available.},

Mitochondrial morphology changes are tightly regulated, and their shape can shift between small, fragmented units and larger networks of elongated mitochondria. We demonstrate that mitochondrial elements become significantly elongated and interconnected shortly after nutrient depletion. This mitochondrial morphological shift depends on the type of starvation, with an additive effect observed when multiple nutrients are depleted simultaneously. We further show that starvation-induced mitochondrial elongation is mediated by down-regulation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) through modulation of two Drp1 phosphorylation sites, leading to unopposed mitochondrial fusion. Finally, we establish that mitochondrial tubulation upon nutrient deprivation protects mitochondria from autophagosomal degradation, which could permit mitochondria to maximize energy production and supply autophagosomal membranes during starvation.},

Usually, it is the ability of the mitochondria to make ATP appropriately in response to energy demands. Where other functions are of interest, tailored solutions are required. Dysfunction can be assessed in isolated mitochondria, in cells or in vivo, with different balances between precise experimental control and physiological relevance. There are many methods to measure mitochondrial function and dysfunction in these systems. Generally, measurements of fluxes give more information about the ability to make ATP than do measurements of intermediates and potentials. For isolated mitochondria, the best assay is mitochondrial respiratory control: the increase in respiration rate in response to ADP. For intact cells, the best assay is the equivalent measurement of cell respiratory control, which reports the rate of ATP production, the proton leak rate, the coupling efficiency, the maximum respiratory rate, the respiratory control ratio and the spare respiratory capacity. Measurements of membrane potential provide useful additional information. Measurement of both respiration and potential during appropriate titrations enables the identification of the primary sites of effectors and the distribution of control, allowing deeper quantitative analyses. Many other measurements in current use can be more problematic, as discussed in the present review.},

In actuality, this membrane is pleomorphic, with narrow tubular regions connecting the internal compartments (cristae) to each other and to the membrane periphery. The membrane topologies observed in condensed (matrix contracted) and orthodox (matrix expanded) mitochondria cannot be interconverted by passive folding and unfolding. Instead, transitions between these morphological states likely involve membrane fusion and fission. Formation of tubular junctions in the inner membrane appears to be energetically favored, because they form spontaneously in yeast mitochondria following large-amplitude swelling and recontraction. However, aberrant, unattached, vesicular cristae are also observed in these mitochondria, suggesting that formation of cristae junctions depends on factors (such as the distribution of key proteins and/or lipids) that are disrupted during extreme swelling. Computer modeling studies using the “Virtual Cell” program suggest that the shape of the inner membrane can influence mitochondrial function. Simulations indicate that narrow cristae junctions restrict diffusion between intracristal and external compartments, causing depletion of ADP and decreased ATP output inside the cristae.},

We used a TMT9-plex strategy to determine alterations in relative protein abundance due to a particular carbon source, in triplicate, thereby permitting subsequent statistical analyses. We quantified over 4700 proteins across all 9 samples, of which 1003 demonstrated statistically significant differences in abundance in at least one condition. The majority of altered proteins were classified as functioning in metabolic processes and as having cellular origins of plasma membrane and mitochondria. In contrast, proteins remaining relatively unchanged in abundance included those having nucleic acid-related processes, such as transcription and RNA processing. In addition, the comprehensiveness of the dataset enabled the analysis of subsets of functionally-related proteins, such as phosphatases, kinases, and transcription factors.

Using a screen for mitophagy-deficient mutants, we found that YIL146C/ECM37 is essential for mitophagy. This gene is not required for other types of selective autophagy or for nonspecific macroautophagy. We designated this autophagy-related (ATG) gene as ATG32. The Atg32 protein localizes on mitochondria. Following the induction of mitophagy, Atg32 binds Atg11, an adaptor protein for selective types of autophagy, and then Atg32 is recruited to and imported into the vacuole along with mitochondria. Therefore, Atg32 confers selectivity for mitochondrial sequestration as a cargo and is necessary for recruitment of this organelle by the autophagy machinery for mitophagy.},

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:1076-1080, 1990]. However, we found that the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum were specifically stained if the dye concentration was increased or if certain respiratory-deficient yeast strains were examined. The quality of nuclear envelope staining with DiOC6 was sufficiently sensitive to reveal alterations in the nuclear envelope known as karmellae. These membranes were previously apparent only by electron microscopy. At the high dye concentrations required to stain the nuclear envelope, wild-type cells could no longer grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. In spite of this effect on mitochondrial function, the presence of high dye concentration did not adversely affect cell viability or general growth characteristics when strains were grown under standard conditions on glucose. Consequently, time-lapse confocal microscopy was used to examine organelle dynamics in living yeast cells stained with DiOC6. These in vivo observations correlated very well with previous electron microscopic studies, including analyses of mitochondria, karmellae, and mitosis. For example, cycles of mitochondrial fusion and division, as well as the changes in nuclear shape and position that occur during mitosis, were readily imaged in time-lapse studies of living DiOC6-stained cells. This technique also revealed new aspects of nuclear disposition and interactions with other organelles. For example, the nucleus and vacuole appeared to form a structurally coupled unit that could undergo coordinated movements. Furthermore, unlike the general view that nuclear movements occur only in association with division, the nucleus/vacuole underwent dramatic migrations around the cell periphery as cells exited from stationary phase. In addition to the large migrations or rotations of the nucleus/vacuole, DiOC6 staining also revealed more subtle dynamics, including the forces of the spindle on the nuclear envelope during mitosis. This technique should have broad application in analyses of yeast cell structure and function.},

	abstract = {Hexokinase II is an enzyme central to glucose metabolism and glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of HXK2, the gene which encodes hexokinase II, dramatically changed the physiology of S. cerevisiae. The hxk2-null mutant strain displayed fully oxidative growth at high glucose concentrations in early exponential batch cultures, resulting in an initial absence of fermentative products such as ethanol, a postponed and shortened diauxic shift, and higher biomass yields. Several intracellular changes were associated with the deletion of hexokinase II. The hxk2 mutant had a higher mitochondrial H+-ATPase activity and a lower pyruvate decarboxylase activity, which coincided with an intracellular accumulation of pyruvate in the hxk2 mutant. The concentrations of adenine nucleotides, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate are comparable in the wild type and the hxk2 mutant. In contrast, the concentration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase, is clearly lower in the hxk2 mutant than in the wild type. The results suggest a redirection of carbon flux in the hxk2 mutant to the production of biomass as a consequence of reduced glucose repression.},

The effects of classical uncouplers, fatty acids, uncoupling proteins (UCP1–UCP5) and thyroid hormones on the efficiency of OxPhos are described. Furthermore, the present knowledge on intrinsic uncoupling of cytochrome c oxidase (decrease of H+/e− stoichiometry=slip) is reviewed. Among the three proton pumps of the respiratory chain of mitochondria and bacteria, only cytochrome c oxidase is known to exhibit a slip of proton pumping. Intrinsic uncoupling was shown after chemical modification, by site-directed mutagenesis of the bacterial enzyme, at high membrane potential ΔΨ, and in a tissue-specific manner to increase thermogenesis in heart and skeletal muscle by high ATP/ADP ratios, and in non-skeletal muscle tissues by palmitate. In addition, two mechanisms of respiratory control are described. The first occurs through the membrane potential ΔΨ and maintains high ΔΨ values (150–200 mV). The second occurs only in mitochondria, is suggested to keep ΔΨ at low levels (100–150 mV) through the potential dependence of the ATP synthase and the allosteric ATP inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase at high ATP/ADP ratios, and is reversibly switched on by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. Finally, the regulation of ΔΨ and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria at high ΔΨ values (150–200 mV) are discussed.},

	abstract = {By dividing asymmetrically, stem cells can generate two daughter cells with distinct fates. However, evidence is limited in mammalian systems for the selective apportioning of subcellular contents between daughters. We followed the fates of old and young organelles during the division of human mammary stemlike cells and found that such cells apportion aged mitochondria asymmetrically between daughter cells. Daughter cells that received fewer old mitochondria maintained stem cell traits. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission disrupted both the age-dependent subcellular localization and segregation of mitochondria and caused loss of stem cell properties in the progeny cells. Hence, mechanisms exist for mammalian stemlike cells to asymmetrically sort aged and young mitochondria, and these are important for maintaining stemness properties.
Stem cells can sort mitochondria by age
The renewal of tissues in aging organisms requires stem cells, which have the unusual ability to divide asymmetrically into one daughter cell that retains stem cell properties and another that differentiates into a particular tissue type. Katajisto et al. used photoactivated marker proteins to monitor the age of cell organelles in stemlike cells from human breast tissue and their distribution into daughter cells. Most organelles were evenly distributed, but daughter cells that maintained stem-cell properties received more newly produced mitochondria and fewer old ones.

	abstract = {The Notch signaling pathway is mediated by cell-cell interactions and is used extensively throughout embryonic development and the maintenance of tissues and stem cells in adults. Notch signaling requires a series of proteolytic cleavage events to release the Notch intracellular domain that functions directly in signal transduction. Furthermore, ligand cells binding to Notch must be capable of ligand endocytosis to activate signaling. Two different ligand endocytic events--ligand recycling or the pulling of ligand on Notch--have been proposed to explain the requirement for ligand internalization. Our biochemical and cellular studies identify Notch-induced ligand ubiquitination that promotes interactions with epsin endocytic adaptors, which along with dynamin and actin allow ligand cells to activate signaling in Notch cells. In order to determine whether endocytosis enables ligand recycling to generate high-affinity Notch binding, we integrated optical tweezers with cell biological and biochemical methods. Results indicate blocking endocytosis and/or recycling does not alter the binding strength of ligand-expressing cells to laser-trapped Notch coated beads, however, blocking endocytosis does prevent ligand cells from physically pulling on laser-trapped Notch beads. Together these results propose Notch contact induces ligand cells to form clathrin-dependent endocytic structures specialized in mechanical force to physically pull on Notch and activate signaling.},

Here, we present a microscopy approach for automated quantification of Δψ and mitochondrial position, shape and calcium handling in individual living cells. In the base protocol, cells are stained with tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), a fluorescent cation that accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix according to Δψ, and visualized using video-microscopy. Next, the acquired images are processed to generate a mitochondria-specific binary image (mask) allowing simultaneous quantification of mitochondrial TMRM fluorescence intensity, shape and position. In a more advanced version of this protocol a mitochondria-targeted variant of green fluorescent protein (mitoAcGFP1) is expressed to allow mask making in TMRM-stained cells. The latter approach allows quantification of Δψ in cells with a substantially depolarized Δψ. For automated quantification of mitochondrial calcium handling in space and time mitoAcGFP1-expressing cells are stained with rhod-2, a fluorescent calcium indicator that accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE—β-Cell response to glucose is characterized by mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) hyperpolarization and the production of metabolites that serve as insulin secretory signals. We have previously shown that glucose-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization accompanies the concentration-dependent increase in insulin secretion within a wide range of glucose concentrations. This observation represents the integrated response of a large number of mitochondria within each individual cell. However, it is currently unclear whether all mitochondria within a single β-cell represent a metabolically homogenous population and whether fuel or other stimuli can recruit or silence sizable subpopulations of mitochondria. This study offers insight into the different metabolic states of β-cell mitochondria.
RESULTS—We show that mitochondria display a wide heterogeneity in ΔΨ and a millivolt range that is considerably larger than the change in millivolts induced by fuel challenge. Increasing glucose concentration recruits mitochondria into higher levels of homogeneity, while an in vitro diabetes model results in increased ΔΨ heterogeneity. Exploration of the mechanism behind heterogeneity revealed that temporary changes in ΔΨ of individual mitochondria, ATP-hydrolyzing mitochondria, and uncoupling protein 2 are not significant contributors to ΔΨ heterogeneity. We identified BAD, a proapoptotic BCL-2 family member previously implicated in mitochondrial recruitment of glucokinase, as a significant factor influencing the level of heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS—We suggest that mitochondrial ΔΨ heterogeneity in β-cells reflects a metabolic reservoir recruited by an increased level of fuels and therefore may serve as a therapeutic target.},

Moreover, the myo2-66 mutant, which carries a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Myo2p motor domain, exhibited a 55\% decrease in accumulation of mitochondria in the bud tip, and an increase in accumulation of mitochondria at the retention site in the mother cell after shift to restrictive temperatures.

	abstract = {Additional neurological features have recently been described in seven families transmitting pathogenic mutations in OPA1, the most common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy. However, the frequency of these syndromal ‘dominant optic atrophy plus’ variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20\% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06, 95\% confidence interval = 1.44–6.49; P = 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio = 2.29, 95\% confidence interval = 1.08–4.82; P = 0.0271). Histochemical and molecular characterization of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed the presence of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the majority of patients harbouring OPA1 mutations, even in those with isolated optic nerve involvement. However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology. Individuals with dominant optic atrophy plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes, and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant visual impairment.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria form a highly interconnected tubular network throughout the cell via a dynamic process, with mitochondrial segments fusing and breaking apart continuously. Strong evidence has emerged to implicate disturbed mitochondrial fusion and fission as central pathological components underpinning a number of childhood and adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Several proteins that regulate the morphology of the mitochondrial network have been identified, the most widely studied of which are optic atrophy 1 and mitofusin 2. Pathogenic mutations that disrupt these two pro-fusion proteins cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy and axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2A, respectively. These disorders predominantly affect specialized neurons that require precise shuttling of mitochondria over long axonal distances. Considerable insight has also been gained by carefully dissecting the deleterious consequences of imbalances in mitochondrial fusion and fission on respiratory chain function, mitochondrial quality control (mitophagy), and programmed cell death. Interestingly, these cellular processes are also implicated in more-common complex neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, indicating a common pathological thread and a close relationship with mitochondrial structure, function and localization. Understanding how these fundamental processes become disrupted will prove crucial to the development of therapies for the growing number of neurodegenerative disorders linked to disturbed mitochondrial dynamics.

	abstract = {Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and autosomal-dominant optic atrophy (DOA) are the two most common inherited optic neuropathies in the general population. Both disorders share striking pathological similarities, marked by the selective loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the early involvement of the papillomacular bundle. Three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations; m.3460G{\textgreater}A, m.11778G{\textgreater}A, and m.14484T{\textgreater}C account for over 90\% of LHON cases, and in DOA, the majority of affected families harbour mutations in the OPA1 gene, which codes for a mitochondrial inner membrane protein. Optic nerve degeneration in LHON and DOA is therefore due to disturbed mitochondrial function and a predominantly complex I respiratory chain defect has been identified using both in vitro and in vivo biochemical assays. However, the trigger for RGC loss is much more complex than a simple bioenergetic crisis and other important disease mechanisms have emerged relating to mitochondrial network dynamics, mtDNA maintenance, axonal transport, and the involvement of the cytoskeleton in maintaining a differential mitochondrial gradient at sites such as the lamina cribosa. The downstream consequences of these mitochondrial disturbances are likely to be influenced by the local cellular milieu. The vulnerability of RGCs in LHON and DOA could derive not only from tissue-specific, genetically-determined biological factors, but also from an increased susceptibility to exogenous influences such as light exposure, smoking, and pharmacological agents with putative mitochondrial toxic effects. Our concept of inherited mitochondrial optic neuropathies has evolved over the past decade, with the observation that patients with LHON and DOA can manifest a much broader phenotypic spectrum than pure optic nerve involvement. Interestingly, these phenotypes are sometimes clinically indistinguishable from other neurodegenerative disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and multiple sclerosis, where mitochondrial dysfunction is also thought to be an important pathophysiological player. A number of vertebrate and invertebrate disease models has recently been established to circumvent the lack of human tissues, and these have already provided considerable insight by allowing direct RGC experimentation. The ultimate goal is to translate these research advances into clinical practice and new treatment strategies are currently being investigated to improve the visual prognosis for patients with mitochondrial optic neuropathies.},
