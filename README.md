# Thesis
My Thesis which which I defended in 2015.

##Notes
This is a XeteX version of my thesis. I recommend using [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) and [MikTex](http://miktex.org/) to auto-install all required packages. In addition I used the [minted](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/minted?lang=en) package for software syntax highlighting. In order for the package to run properly, `--shell-escape` flag option must be invoked [(more info here)](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/99475/how-to-invoke-latex-with-the-shell-escape-flag-in-texmakerx).
